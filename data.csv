The Search for Information and the Net Generation,C,2007,Combes,Lecturer,Edith Cowan Univesity,,,,,,,,,,,,,Australia,International Association of School Librarianship,Taipei,Surveys,Interviews,Quantitative,http://search.proquest.com/docview/236035428/abstract?accountid=14474,"Supporters of the Net Generation theory claim that children born after 1985 have an in-depth grasp and almost 'intuitive' knowledge of how to use technology, simply because they have never known a world without the Internet and technological change. This theory contradicts traditional information theory which contends that information-seeking behaviour is a complex activity that is affected by cultural, educational and social contexts. Anecdotal evidence from schools and public libraries has long suggested that while young people actively use technology, they do not use it as described by the Net generation theorists. In recent years there has been an emerging body of research on the Net Generation that largely debunks the myth of an intuitive user who is capable of using electronic resources to find information, a fact many teacher librarians have long suspected. This paper explores the initial findings of research into the information-seeking behaviour of young adults and how they use a range of technologies and electronic resources.

Getting Pat 'shsssh': Online Focus Groups as Empowering Professional Development for Teacher Librarians,C,2007,Mardis,Professor,Wayne State University,Hoffman,Associate Professor,University of Hawaii at Manoa,,,,,,,,,,United States,International Association of School Librarianship,Taipei,Online Focus Group,,Qualitative,http://search.proquest.com/docview/236046603/abstract?accountid=14474,"This methodological review reports how online focus groups not only benefit the qualitative researcher but also provide professional growth among participants. The authors suggest that for school librarians, who often have limited opportunities for tailored professional development, focus groups can rapidly build a community of practice that transcends the original purpose of the researcher, enhancing knowledge and empowering new actions within schools following the model of Denzin (1997). By providing interaction, self-reflection, and professional sharing, the online focus group is a potentially powerful tool to include educators who share a professional culture but would not easily be reached by in-person techniques, as well as a method through which researchers can foster meaningful beneficial opportunities for professional learning and empowerment.

The participant observation study is the second phase of a two-phase mixed methods study, which explores the capacity of public libraries in South Africa for information literacy education  in the context of the dire shortage of school libraries. The focus in the second phase is on the connections between public libraries and schools. However, the relations between the two libraries and their staff members are found to impact on these relations with the study finding that historical context and the conflicts arising from unequal positions of power impact significantly on information literacy education in the town. The paper concentrates, however, on just two threads of enquiry: the views of teachers and principals in the seven schools of the town on the educational role of libraries as revealed in interviews; and pupils use of the two public libraries in seeking information for their school assignments. The study reveals a lack of cognizance of the high level demands of information-seeking in libraries among the teachers. They tend to see the library as a warehouse from which things are fetched. The study finds a paradox  a gulf certainly exists between the public libraries and schools buts but the gulf comes from shared limited conceptions of the educational role of public libraries and of information literacy.

Issues given prominence by Patricia Glass Schuman's Social Responsibilities and Libraries, published in 1976 were revisited. As an area of larger community structure and debates of public good, the perennial topic of interest is fast becoming the current hot topic of librarianship. Literacy and learning have long been critical areas where librarians focus service, skills and programming in public libraries. This research project seeks to examine how librarians perceive other issues that often go hand-in-hand with literacy to help individuals and society achieve full potential. The research in this presentation and paper is part of a coauthored book that primarily examined politics and the public library discussing issues given new flavour in a post 9/11 world, economic rationalism and social responsibility, public Library as Social Space, engaging the poor and those marginalized because of access limitations. Freedom of information and privacy are perennial issues for libraries. It is clear that literacy continues to be a key issue for public libraries. Researchers analyzed responses received from open-ended questions on library professional listservs and present findings that indicate what librarians perceive as the role of public libraries to further socially responsible policy. They provide some insight into the most compelling issues for librarians, and what changes in librarian's/library roles have been perceived since 9/11. The findings from the study are also presented in the context of the impact it bears for school libraries, outlining further studies in that area.

The purpose of this pilot study was to examine students' reflections on the information skills process following the use of an information skills scaffold (the PLUS model) during the completion of an assignment in a secondary school in the UK. The study takes a constructivist approach and data was gathered via a post-assignment questionnaire given to students. Results show that students' confidence was variable at the start of the assignment; that students found the completion of a concept map to be generally helpful; that almost 50% of students found that completing a concept map made them more confident; that students used the concept map when searching for information; that students used a range of print and electronic sources of information; that students' preferences for using particular types of resources included both print and electronic sources; that students found the PLUS model to be helpful with their project; and that most students were prepared to consider using the model when completing future assignments.

The research builds on previous studies which identified some of the supports that facilitate elementary teachers' use of children's books in their teaching (e.g., access to teacher-librarians, funding for materials, and opportunities for professional development). The case study school district was committed to supporting the work of teachers through the school library and had these supports in place. The study participants had clear ideas about what it meant to them to be Canadian and about the values that were important to them as Canadians. They believed it was important to incorporate Canadian books into classroom activities. However, they often felt a need to justify their use of Canadian books, whereas they unquestioningly used American books in their teaching across the curriculum. Overall, they were more knowledgeable about Canadian books and Canadian authors and illustrators than teachers in earlier studies. The teachers relied on the recommendations of the teacher-librarians about books, but they rarely collaborated with teacher-librarians in selecting and using Canadian books with their students. The research report concludes with questions about lost potential in terms of the power of books to enhance children's sense of national identity and their sense of social cohesion.

A study of 632 of the poorest U.S. schools shows a strong relationship between national information policy regarding achievement in the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 and local decisions to use AR, expectations for literacy, and library collection development. Investigation in the U.K. schools finds that (a) motivational style interacts with gender in relation to the competitive and social aspects of the AR program, (b) the level of program implementation does not correlate with breadth of reading, and (c) management aspects of the program are not utilized effectively. Results suggest that how the AR program relates to information policy, information literacy, and knowledge management has importance for school librarians and libraries.

This research set out to investigate whether an e-learning environment designed by students themselves would scale easily in schools. To do so, the GENESIS Project, a collaborative undertaking between three schools and a University, created the opportunity for students as researchers to conceive, prototype, and test an e-learning environment in which they and other students could explore ideas of interest to them. Preliminary findings show that students are able to design e-learning environments that provide good contexts for learning. Furthermore, such an approach appears to set in motion deep and lasting change in schools in ways that align with Coburn's (2003) four ways of thinking about scaling up. The Project demonstrates, in all its phases, a way in which students themselves can take information leadership of curriculum in a culture of change.

These skills are keys to lifelong learning. Standard assessment tools, such as select response, closed-constructed response, and even open-ended-constructed response questions are sufficiently dynamic to align with the real-world experiences of learners exercising information literacy skills. In this study, an information structure was designed for students to use to describe learning activities. These written, student-generated items become part of a student's portfolio.

The territorial behavior observed in the libraries could be seen in where the students decided to sit and how they used library furniture (including chairs, armchairs, computers and the librarian station). Most of the students preferred sitting in a central area in the library. However, for the most part, students chose to sit in places that enabled them to maintain territorial control. While many students sat in groups for both social and study purposes, some of them (particularly the older students) had a need to protect against intrusion into their personal space. This was achieved by sitting at the tables with their backs to the entrance, by body language and, at times, even by using personal belongings to demarcate personal territory. Library planners and librarians must be aware of these ""conflicting"" needs in order to adapt the design to the behaviors typical of the groups that use the library.

The findings point to a trend towards computer acceptance and transformational leadership, albeit some indications of computer anxiety, some feelings about the lack of computer usefulness and ease of use, as well as leadership issues, like the lack of functional school libraries. One of the most relevant findings was the positive correlation between perceived ease of use of the computer statement to some leadership constructs.

Significant differences were found regarding both complaints about book content and librarians' response, between the religious sectors and the non-religious one, indicating a much lower rate in the latter. More complaints were received from teachers than principals, but the latter elicited a higher compliance, probably due to their special status in school. Very little parental involvement was reported, receiving the lowest compliance. Topics of the complaints ranked as follows: pornography, degrading the Jewish religion, hard violence, sexual permissiveness, missionizing, racism, drug use, holocaust denial and bizarre sects. Pornography and violence ranked high in all sectors, but sexual permissiveness and degrading Judaism ranked high among the two religious sectors but much lower in the non-religious one. Few complaints about certain genres may result from preliminary censorship during book selection process, but in most cases it indicates less sensitivity in that sector concerning that genre.

A study conducted in Canada in 1999-2002 examined Internet use in schools through interviews with technology leaders, through surveys of teachers and principals, and through case study investigations of three school districts, each in a different province of Canada. The case study data from the three districts was analyzed, using the NVivo software program, to address three main questions: (1) To what extent was teachers' use of the Internet consistent with ""best practice,"" as described by Moersch (1999)? (2) What types of support systems appeared to be essential for effective Internet use in classrooms to occur? (3) What was the role of the teacher-librarian in contributing to effective Internet use in classrooms? The study showed that teachers were integrating the Internet into their teaching, but had not yet achieved ""best practice,"" and that teacher-librarians were influential in supporting teachers' progress towards ""best practice"" in the use of the Internet in instruction.

The research project reported here examines the impact of the school library resource centre on learning. Using a range of focus groups, interviews and case studies, the work identified a range of potential indicators of learning which provide a useful starting point for librarians to begin examining activities in relation to the learner. The study was conducted in Scottish secondary schools between August 1999 and February 2001 and complements empirical work carried out in other countries. All these studies were the subject of a critical review of literature recently completed by the research team. The paper discusses some of the major themes that emerge from the empirical study and were reflected in other studies; such as the impact the library has on formal academic attainment and informal personal achievements, factors that limit the learning and how this relates to the type of library provision in terms of resources and professional expertise.

A national policy is generally motivated by public and political party concerns and legislation is passed as the best option to meet the ideal set by the government for the issue(s) on hand. Within modern society education can be linked to national development. School libraries form an integral part of the modern approach to teaching and learning. School library development in South Africa is shown to be problematic in a number of ways. Similar problems exist in other African countries. Recommendations are made for the government of South Africa to address these issues in a national information policy.

Students seldom used the catalogue card for searching and only a small percentage reported that they were able to find the books successfully using the catalogue card. Based on the findings, a conceptual model of the prototype automated catalogue was developed - Virtual Library for use in primary schools, and ELIS for secondary schools. Both systems are divided into two main modules, the Administrator and the User module. User acceptance test showed that the majority of students found the systems user friendly. Students were also successful in the search tasks given. A high majority described the graphical user interface to be attractive and simple.

Implementing flexible scheduling in elementary libraries,C,1999,McGregor,Professor,Texas Woman's University,,,,,,,,,,,,,USA,International Association of School Librarianship,USA,Interviews,,Qualitative,http://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED437053,"Flexible scheduling in school libraries can provide a mechanism for achieving the learning goals and objectives of both the school library program and the curriculum by making information available at the point of need and by promoting use of the library and its services at a relevant moment instead of on a predetermined schedule. This pilot study examined the successful implementation of flexible scheduling in six elementary schools where no funding was received to support implementation. Specifically, the study examined: why flexible scheduling was implemented in elementary schools where funding was not contingent on it; factors that influenced implementation; and stakeholders' basis for their claim of the success of implementation. Telephone interviews with librarians, principals, and teachers provided the data. The preliminary results indicate that, in those schools with successful implementations, flexible scheduling was only a tool to achieve another internal curricular objective, such as curriculum integration or literacy improvement. In addition, education of stakeholders is essential; it must emphasize strategies for effective use of the programs supported by flexible scheduling and their potential learning outcomes rather than simply provide information on how flexible scheduling works.

With a total investment exceeding $45 million, Library Power is the largest nongovernmental funding for school library media programs in over 30 years. It operated in approximately 700 schools and served more than one million students. Library Power sought to create a national vision of public elementary and middle school library media programs through the instructional leadership of the library media specialist and through partnerships within the district and with the community. This study summarizes selected findings of a national evaluation of Library Power and discusses implications for preservice and continuing education of teachers, principals, and library media specialists, as well as the likelihood of institutionalization of Library Power practices. The evaluation found that the Library Power initiative advanced the notion of a student-centered library media program in a learning community. It showed that, given the right conditions, school library media programs can promote positive opportunities for excellence in teaching and learning.

The three students who were able to establish a clear focus were the only ones who demonstrated all aspects of authentic learning. An additional research question dealt with the types of resources used by the students. Books and videocassettes were the primary sources used by students. All students were highly dependent on the teacher as a source of information. The absence of collaboration between the teacher, the school librarian, and public librarian is noted. Examination of cooperative learning, intervention, required assignment deadlines, and the format of products as each of these relates to independent research projects is recommended.

The methodology used in the study incorporated both survey and case study. Empirical data collected by survey concentrated particularly on the current level of service provision to students with disabilities, while case study investigations also looked at management factors. The focus was on the relationship between the school library staff and the special education staff, and the effect this had on provision of school library services and the acquisition of information skills by students with disabilities.

The study examined the impact of whole language in terms of its effect on the library program and the librarian. The study also sought to understand the change agent role each librarian played during implementation of the philosophy. Specifically, the following questions were addressed: (1) What changes occurred in the knowledge, perceptions, practices, and beliefs of the librarians? (2) What changes did the librarians make in the library programs as a result of whole language? (3) What roles did the school librarians play during the implementation of whole language? and (4) How did the librarians feel about the whole language philosophy and its impact on the library program? Data collection techniques included participant observation; interviews with librarians, principals, and teachers; and examination of relevant documents. Findings indicated that the level of success each librarian experienced varied and was dependent on the culture of the school, principal support, the librarian's knowledge and interpersonal skills, the librarian's reaction to district level changes, and time.

The first study was a comparison of professional development processes and children's learning outcomes in four elementary schools. Surveys used to uncover perceptions of information literacy development were followed by on-site workshops for teachers of 7 to 11 year olds. This provided a snapshot of challenges that are a function of different school cultures and teachers with varying levels of information literacy understanding and commitment, as well as revealing much about children as information problem solvers. The second study involved all teaching staff at a single elementary school. Again, aspects of the teachers' information literacy were revealed alongside those of children. Observing the students' information problem solving experience was a key element in professional development. Reflection on teaching practice was heightened by use of action research as the teachers' major learning activity. Findings in the following areas are highlighted: (1) school information cultures--frameworks, policies, and library management; (2) teachers' understanding and expectations about information skills; (3) effects of expectations of children as information problem solvers; (4) connecting teachers' and children's thinking and expectations; (5) the teaching and learning interface; and (6) relationships among staff.

The research findings indicate that there is a significant difference between boys and girls in the influence of the design of the learning interfaces on their level of time on task as well as on their level of satisfaction with the different interfaces. Boys on the one hand had a higher level of time on task, and were more familiar with computer games so they looked for assistance through navigational buttons; girls on the other hand tended to ask for help with the game.

Censorship in high school libraries in Israel: an exploratory field study,C,1998,Yitzhaki,Professor,Bar-Ilan University,,,,,,,,,,,,,Israel,International Association of School Librarianship,Israel,Questionnaire,,Quantitative,http://search.proquest.com/docview/236050481?pq-origsite=gscholar,"The issue of censorship in school libraries has long concerned researchers and practitioners in the field and is well documented in literature. A literature survey reveals dozens of opinion articles as well as research papers reporting empirical field studies, especially in the US, which attempt to determine the extent and objects of censorship and its underlying factors. Although school libraries have existed in Israel for several decades, some of them dating back to the 50's, the issue of censorship has not been studied. The objective of the present exploratory study was to empirically assess the current state of censorship in a sample of high school libraries in the country. The sample comprised 25 high schools, from both the 'religious' and 'non-religious' sectors. The main research tool was a two-parts questionnaire, designed to be filled out during researchers visit to the library. Most librarians reported that some form of control, restriction or censorship was, always or very often, applied to books to be added to the collection, usually by the head librarian. No library had any kind of written document, or even some permanent unwritten statement specifying instructions or policy regarding book acquisition. None of the librarians mentioned any external pressure to censor the existing collection or books to be acquired, and it was dear that the only censorship was an internal one, initiated by the librarians themselves and other members of the school staff. In both sectors there was wide agreement on banning titles which included violence, hard pomography, racism and drugs, but there were considerable differences regarding 'soft' pornography, Holocaust denial, sexual pemissiveness and books degrading the Jewish religion or its values, principles or commands. A comparison of four lists of specific titles against the catalogs showed that the `non-religious' libraries owned three times the percentage from the first list (explicit violence and sex), but only half the percentage from the fourth list ('Judaism), compared to the 'religious' one. Interestingly, the religious group had lower percentages of both the 'rightist' and 'leftist' lists, due to its smaller collections, but relatively more from the 'rightist' list than the 'leftist' one.",Censorship,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The power of information literacy: unity of education and resourcesfor the 21st century,C,1997,Todd,Professor,Rutgers,Lamb,Doctoral Student,,McNicholas,Doctoral Student,,,,,,,,USA,International Association of School Librarianship,Canada,Observation,Interviewing,Qualitative,http://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED354916,"Information literacy is the ability to use information purposefully and effectively. It is a holistic, interactive learning process encompassing the skills-based phases of defining, locating, selecting, organizing, presenting, and evaluating information from sources that include books and other media, experiences, and people; being able to consider information in light of knowledge; adding information to current knowledge; and applying this knowledge to solve information needs. An approach for promoting information literacy and establishing an integrated information skills program in a school is described. At Marist Sisters' College, a secondary school in Sydney (Australia), an action research project has attempted to place information literacy at the center of the curriculum. Using R. G. Havelock's model of the change agent, a range of change agent activities has been used. Qualitative evaluation through interviews with 8 teachers and 110 students in grades 7, 9, and 11 has demonstrated the positive impacts of the approach on student self-concept, the learning process, the view of information, learning outcomes, and the learning environment. Three appendixes contain a summary of the information process, change agent activities, and a diagram of the planning model. (Contains 12 references.)

Most of the eReader-specific research examined younger participants in an academic setting. The purpose of this phenomenological study was to describe the perspectives of Georgia senior adults in their adoption of eReaders. The adoption of an eReader was generally defined as the acquisition of an eReader, followed by the selecting, downloading, navigating, and reading of eBooks using an eReader. This study took place in a public library and was designed to answer 3 research questions: (a) What are contributing factors in senior adultst decisions to use eBooks? (b) How do senior adults describe their eReader experiences? (c) What are the challenges and benefits of senior adults regarding the use of eReaders? Data were collected from questionnaires completed by 29 eReader owners age 50 and over. From this group, 8 individuals were interviewed and 6 participated in a focus group. The data were analyzed and 4 themes emerged: Passion for eReader and eBook Selection; Sense of Economic Value; Comfort with Technology; and Interest in Future Direction of Technology. The intended use of the eReader influenced whether a single- or multi-function device was purchased. Costs associated with ownership included an initial outlay for an eReader, the price for eBooks, which were sometimes free, and for some participants, membership in Amazon Prime. The participants were involved in technology from an early age, whether at home, school, or work and maintained a keen interest not only in the state of current technology, but also in the future direction that technology was headed. The themes represented a snapshot in time for participants from a community with above average income and education levels.",Library science,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One area of focus has been on the integration of commercial off-the-shelf games in lesson plans. A predictive factor for the adoption and integration of digital games is the attitudes or readiness of teachers. Yet, while many studies have examined this with teachers themselves, teacher librarians (TLs) have largely been ignored, despite the key role they play in education and technology adoption in schools. This study attempted to determine TLs' beliefs and practices about digital games as 21st century learning tools, to examine similarities and differences with those of classroom teachers, and to see if and how TLs' pedagogical beliefs impacted their perceptions of barriers toward digital game adoption. The Teachers' Attitudes Toward Games (TATG) Survey measured TLs' perceptions of barriers to using digital games. Findings suggest that TLs tended to use digital games to address discrete libraryskills--a behaviorist practice--despite the fact that they tended to hold constructivist pedagogical beliefs. Though, evidence showed that some were using games to integrate 21st century skills into classroom lessons. Similar to findings on classroom teachers, TLs perceived lack of time, lack of infrastructure, and lack of support as barriers to using digital games. Furthermore, TLs with behaviorist beliefs tended to perceive greater barriers to using digital games as compared to TLs with constructivist beliefs.",educational technology,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, when considering the rate at which students accessed library materials in grades four, five and six at a rural elementary school in Pennsylvania, this research found a sharp decline. With this in mind, the purpose of this action research study was to implement an e-book lending program in this school to increase the rate at which students accessed reading material. The theoretical framework for this study includes elements of Rogers' (2003) diffusion of innovations theory to explain the benefits of an initiative such as e-book lending. This dissertation addresses two research questions. First, is there a significant difference between the numbers of times fourth through sixth grade students access library material (e-books, books, or audio-visual materials) after the implementation of an e-reader lending program? Second, what are students' reactions to the e-reader lending program? To consider the first question, my alternative hypothesis states that the e-book lending program has changed the reading behavior of the students involved, while my null hypothesis states that the reading behavior of the students involved is unchanged. The methodology for this research is twofold. In the first part, students were made aware of the e-book lending program and chose whether or not to use e-readers to view e-book material for a period of six weeks, after which a test was performed to determine whether or not reading at the school increased. In the second part, students were interviewed individually to gauge their feelings about the program. The students' comments were then analyzed qualitatively. Considering the results of this research, it is likely that similar initiatives to the e-book lending program would be successful in other educational settings.",Library science,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Librarians working in this environment must cope with continuous change while still providing research support to their primary clientele -- faculty and students. The objective of this dissertation was to determine which competencies library directors and senior managers should possess to guide their organizations through the current turbulent climate of constant change, and to lead their organizations into the future. An evidence-based systematic review of the literature revealed that competencies associated with transformational leadership were highly valued by academic librarians in an environment of rapid change. Similarly competencies associated with emotional intelligence were highly valued attributes in library directors and senior managers. The research found that leadership and management competencies had universal application regardless of profession. Only knowledge-based competencies associated with a profession were not of value in other fields. Strategies for dealing with radical change such as organizational development, systems thinking, appreciative inquiry, creating a learning organization, re-organization of staff, and the frequency and use of library services assessment were found to be tools used by library directors and senior managers to lead academic librarians through a change initiative. Finally, organizational climate and changing the climate were often the focus of library directors as they sought to diminish resistance to change among academic librarians.",Library science,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The literature related to special libraries has reflected this debate over the precise meaning and nature of special libraries for just as many years. This project considers the historical dialog regarding the varied definitions of special libraries that librarians and information professionals have been engaged in for more than a century. Using systematic review, the scholarly and professional literature is examined and analyzed to track definitional and descriptive characteristics of special libraries in the United States to identify how and why changes have occurred over time. Results reveal strong correlations between definition changes and shifting movements in broader library and United States history, especially in relation to the emergence and application of technological advances. Along with encouraging renewed discussion about the boundaries of what we in the field consider special librarianship, this study confirms that rather than permanent and rigid definitions, special libraries have always had dynamic definitions that react to the changing technologies and practices of the profession.",Library science,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recent estimates report that one in 68 children has been diagnosed with autism, with ASD affecting one in 42 boys and one in 189 girls (CDC, 2014). The purpose of this case study was to determine the effectiveness of a video peer modeling and least-to-most prompting intervention targeting the instructional delivery of an information literacy skill to students with ASD in theschool library setting. Research studies have evaluated the effectiveness of video modeling procedures in the acquisition of social initiation, conversational skills, perspective-taking, appropriate play, and functional skills. However, the literature is limited on the effects of video modeling with least-to-most prompting on the acquisition of academic skills in library instructional programs. This research study is significant due to the rapid increase in the identification of students with autism spectrum disorders and current inclusionary practices in both the general education and library classrooms. This single-subject, multiple case study design utilized a descriptive approach to measure baseline, video peer-modeling intervention, and withdrawal phases for the acquisition of skills by five middle school students with autism spectrum disorder in accessing an online computer card catalog to locate a library book in the school collection. The primary question this research study sought to answer was: How does the use of video modeling accompanied by least-to-most prompting affect the acquisition of library information skills in students with autism spectrum disorder (ASD)? The results suggest that video modeling with least-to-most prompting was successful in teaching the five participants to access the online library card catalog to help them select books for academic and leisure activities. The video modeling intervention effectively facilitated the acquisition of the targeted skill for all of the study participants. Each participant was able to acquire the skills needed to complete the task independently with fading of least-to-most prompts within four to twelve sessions. Findings from the current study regarding the efficacy of video modeling intervention add to the literature on the utilization of video modeling procedures in improving academic skills in students with ASD. Results can also be used to strengthen existing educational programs and services for children with ASD in library instructional programs.",Library Science,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Historically being left out of education reforms such as No Child Left Behind in 2001, school media specialists now have the opportunity to shine and show off their unique skill set in curriculum design, information literacy, and research. In collaborating with teachers to carry out lesson plans focused on the CCSS, school librarians can teach students essential skills such as critical thinking, brainstorming, and writing/reading techniques. In discussing why school librarians are needed to complete the success puzzle, the author looks into various course curricula established at Masters of Library Science programs in the United States to trace the development of their skill set, trainings in literacy and research, and the impact these professionals make on a daily basis. The author also shows how school media specialists make a difference in promoting and teaching literacy in inner city schools, which are highly under resourced.

This mixed-method research project examines whether public high school library professionals are self-censoring their library collections when it comes to materials with LGBTQ themes. Quantitative data were collected from 120 Ohio public high school libraries, while 12 school librarians were interviewed. The study found that school libraries tended to have significantly fewer LGBTQ-themed books than titles with other kinds of controversial content, but that certain factors, including schools with large number of students; schools with a racially diverse student body; schools located in liberal-leaning communities; and schools that employ certified librarians, are present in schools with more inclusive LGBTQ collections. Qualitative findings supported the quantitative analyses and stressed the importance of a supportive community and administration when developing a quality, inclusive library collection.",Library Science,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

What has changed is how school librarians perform their roles. As the rate of technological change has accelerated, perceptions of school librarians' roles have not always kept pace. School librarians may base their role perceptions on documentary sources, including professional standards, job descriptions, and performance evaluations. School administrators may have different perceptions of school librarians' roles, based on their past experiences with school librarians. When expected, perceived, and enacted roles differ, school librarians may experience role ambiguity and conflict. With the number of school librarians in decline, those who remain may experience job insecurity.

Using a constructivist theoretical framework, this study was designed to examine the local school administrators' perceptions of the role of the school library media specialist. The research design was a cross-sectional survey. A convenience sample of 82 local school administrators was asked to complete a Likert scale survey that addressed the services offered through the media center, the of those services, and the awareness of services offered that are relative to learning standards. Data were analyzed through a chi-square test to understand the administrative base knowledge for their perceptions or attitudes on the roles, responsibilities, and impact of the school library media center program. A significant difference was found between a knowledge base obtained from administrative training compared to a knowledge base that was gained through personal experiences. These findings suggest that school library media specialists need to provide administrators with more collegial reinforcement such as an instructional support plan that can inform administrators on the intervention resources that school library media specialists can implement. Implications for social change include enhanced educational relationships, improved communication and collaboration amongst educators, and an increased leadership presence within the school library media specialist community.",Library Science,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although school library media specialists (LMSs) have struggled to negotiate their identities in public K12 education for decades, this ""identity crisis"" seems to have reached a critical point due to changes in U.S. learning environments brought about by federal legislation, the implementation of standards-based teaching, the emphasis on standardized criterion referenced testing, and the proliferation and ubiquitous use of computers and the Internet as information sources. Although teacher identity has been thoroughly studied, the ways in which LMSs describe themselves in their professional role and how their identities change from pre-service to in-service are rarely investigated.

The students' social, emotional, and intellectual needs appeared to be met at the school for the most part. The school also exhibited best practices for teaching reading at the middle school level to bilingual students. However, to improve reading, the school would want to consider changing the school's focus from reading comprehension to reading engagement so that students become lifelong readers. In addition, as schools begin to roll out the new educational framework known as the Common Core, which will change how librarians and teachers present reading, and standardized tests assess reading, it is essential that more time be dedicated to exploring point-of-view in informational texts. Finally, because the students tend to score lower on vocabulary than comprehension in reading assessments, increasing the use of free-reading books to introduce vocabulary may provide further opportunities for students to improve on standardized test scores while teaching a valuable lifelong skill. In sum, even a strong school can improve on reading and language arts instruction, and this project shows ways that teachers and librarians can change their thinking to be ready to implement Common Core and still achieve reading engagement.",Library Science,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Moreover, the percentage of ELLs in these schools who met and exceeded the standard for reading and English/language arts on the Georgia Criterion-Referenced Competency Test (CRCT) in the spring of 2010 was more than the Annual Measureable Objective (AMO) of 73.3% or slightly less. The participants were the school library media specialists who administered the school library media programs in these schools. This was a qualitative study. During an inductive thematic analysis, the data coalesced into four themes that corresponded with the research questions: instruction, collaboration, media/technology, and interpersonal communication. These findings were derived from the data. 1. The participants used both conventional and technology-based instructional strategies to support reading and information literacy skills instruction for all of their students, including the ELLs. 2. The school library media collections included first language, bilingual, and multicultural literatures, picture books, nonfiction books written on a lower reading level, graphic materials, Hi-Lo reading materials and other digital resources; however, the materials varied in age, suitability, and condition. 3. The school library media specialists collaborated informally with the other members of the instructional team. 4.

As the passage of time introduced new technologies into the world of education, these standards were reviewed and revised. After each revision, the standards, which were later referred to as guidelines, reflected an updated view on the school librarian's position with additional responsibilities listed in the form of roles. Researchers have explored perceptions of educator groups regarding these roles, to determine if they were accepted by the members of the school community (Church, 2008; Dorrell & Lawson, 1995; Gustafson, 1982; Kaplan, 2006; McCracken, 2001; Mohajerin & Smith, 1981; Person, 1993; Roach, 1989; Schon, Helmstadter, & Robinson, 1991; Scott, 1986; Shannon, 1996; Shelton, 2002). Repeatedly, findings indicated disagreement among the educator groups and an overall lack of support of these roles from teachers, administrators, and even school librarians themselves, in some cases. If a lack of support for the fulfillment of these roles exists, the school libraryprogram cannot develop to its full potential. Consequently, the school librarian cannot fully contribute to student achievement, and a valuable resource is wasted. This study explored perceptions held by educators at the elementary level on the roles of the school librarian, in light of the latest revision to the guidelines (American Association of School Librarians, 2009) which added the role of leader to the list of expectations for school librarians, to determine if a lack of support for the fulfillment of these roles persists.",Library Science,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Several types of scholarly networks are employed as the research instrument to address these four areas, including coauthorship networks, citation networks, co-citation networks, bibliographic coupling networks, topic modeling/networks, and heterogeneous networks. Conceptually, a well-defined framework for quantitative study of scholarly communication is developed; methodologically, the outcome is a set of systematic approaches to evaluate impact (i.e., topic-based PageRank), explore collaboration (i.e., a mix method incorporating community detect, linear regression, and link prediction), identify research topics and specialties (i.e., topic dynamic attributes), and study knowledge flow (i.e., scientific trading and knowledge paths); and empirically, a systematic investigation of scholarly communication (in the above mentioned aspects) in the field of library and information science is accomplished.",Library science,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The e-book is an innovation that purports to replace the printed book; however, students continue to prefer to use the printed book. While students prefer the printed book, academic libraries that provide access to e-books report their e-book collection is being used as much or more than the printed book collection. In this study, eight factors were identified and explored to determine whether one or more of the factors affected undergraduate students' choice to use e-books. A quantitative research design using a convenience sampling method and chi-square analyses was employed in the study. The population of interest was undergraduate students attending Southwest Baptist University, a small, traditional, liberal arts institution. A survey was administered to students attending a university-wide chapel service. Four research questions were developed to explore whether a relationship existed between students' use of e-books and using e-books for leisure reading, using e-books as a textbook, using e-books to conduct research, using e-books to read an assigned reading outside of class, using e-books to read an assigned reading out loud in-class, using e-books as the format of choice, using e-books due to forced adoption, or using e-books due to convenience. Leisure reading, conducting research, forced adoption, and convenience were factors positively related to students' choice to use an e-book. In-class reading was negatively related with students' use of e-books. Textbook use and reading assigned readings were not related with students' choice to use an e-book. When both the printed book and e-book were available, students' choice was positively related with the printed book and negatively related with the e-book. When the e-book was the only format available, students' choice was positively related with the use of the e-book. Finally, students' use of e-books was positively related with convenience.",Library science,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Library budgets are frequently slashed as districts struggle with limited fiscal resources, while library personnel are increasingly expected to provide students with resources they need to help them pass high stakes tests. In an effort to meet student needs with limited resources, many school librarians are using parent volunteers in different capacities. This dissertation explores how three school librarians in different school settings recruited, trained, and used their parent volunteers through the use of an exploratory case study. The researcher conducted observations and semi structured interviews to gain the perspectives of volunteers and librarians regarding the use of volunteers in school libraries. The collection of schedules, photographs, newsletters, and other artifacts enabled the researcher to create a description of three different library volunteer programs. This dissertation explores the motivations of volunteers who participate in volunteer programs, and describes the challenges of operating and maintaining library volunteer programs. Key findings emerged regarding the wishes of parent volunteers to develop authentic partnerships with school staff to engage students in meaningful student learning. Stakeholders interested in establishing or modifying their own volunteer programs could use this data to inform them as they structure school library volunteer programs.",Library Science,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Given the great significance of universities in their societies, it is important that they manage electronic records effectively. It seems a bit odd that universities have not developed adequate responses to the challenge of managing electronic records since many are heavily funded by governments and must comply with multiple regulations that obligate them to manage their records well. Moreover, universities have been the source of much academic research into digital records issues and have access to this expertise, and familiarity with the issues.

To understand better how to control the costs of integration, the research presented here will use structural contingency theory to study the coordination of librarians and technologists within the information commons (IC), a unit of the academic library. Contingency theory seeks to optimize the organizational structures necessary for coordinating partner workflows; it suggests that coordinative structures should be congruent with workflow interdependence. In other words, as workflow interdependence increases, the complexity of coordination necessary to integrate the workflows should also increase. To examine this theory, the work presented here will: (a) test for a positive relationship between coordination and interdependence; (b) test for correlation between perceptions of IC performance and interdependence and coordination congruency; and (c) explore the contingency theory expectation that behavioral differentiation positively affects coordination.",Library science,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The research was in three phases: the first phase aimed to discover and study the school librarians&acirc;&trade; conceptions of information literacy by conducting a pure phenomenographic approach. Six different conceptions of information literacy were emerged as a result to first phase analysis. The second phase aimed to provide the school librarians with a wide range of perspectives, conceptions and thoughts of information literacy discussed worldwide via an information training programme designed especially to serve that purpose. The training programme was designed by the researcher who consulted a broad literature and methods in attempts to integrate different ideas from different territories. For example, she employed business methods such as Eat the Elephant strategy and SWOT analysis, training methods such as icebreaking and team working, Soft System method such as rich picture and mind map, educational methods such as integrating different teaching styles to meet different learning needs style and communication method such as body language and presentations. The third phase aimed to discover the variations and changes in school librarians&acirc;&trade; conceptions of information literacy by conducting a new phenomenographic approach.

This international research provides a bridge between two different disciplines t Comparative Education (Sociology) and Library and Information Science (LIS) t and attempts to provide information to both the educational and library communities throughout Europe regarding the role which SLICs play in the emerging educational global landscape and to determine whether or not these traditional, digital or virtual SLICs, and the work of the school librarian and information specialist, influence the quality of education and improve childrents learning outcomes at different levels. First of all, the study examines a sub-matrix known as the KILM (Kalsbeek Information Literacy Matrix), which was developed as part of an educational matrix between 1997 and 2008 at the Kalsbeek College in Woerden, the Netherlands. The educational matrix attempts to introduce and implement educational reforms, ICT (Information and Communication Technologies) usage, educational technology and new forms of learning throughout the school in a orderly fashion while maintaining a high level of educational quality. This sub-matrix (KILM) identifies the role of the SLIC during the application of the educational matrix. The study then looks at success criteria which became apparent during the application of the sub-matrix and asks whether or not it would be possible to apply similar strategies to other schools libraries and information centres, firstly at Dutch national level and then in school libraries throughout Europe. The staffing, facilities and conditions in school libraries and information centres which were studied vary greatly, however, thanks to the willingness of teachers, school librarians and (school) library associations to share information and data, it has become possible to identify common problems and present some solutions.",Library Science,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Research was conducted using an inductive naturalistic approach in order to address the following question, ""what are the experiences in the lives of upper elementary school children that foster an intrinsic motivation to seek information?"" The conceptual framework for the study was composed of the Taxonomy of Tasks (Bilal, 2002a) and A Theoretical Model of Urban Teen Development (Agosto & Hughes-Hassell, 2006a, 2006b). Self-determination Theory (Deci & Ryan, 1985b) provided the basis for the theoretical framework of the study. Participants were selected from a pool of fifth graders from three diverse schools within a single community. Initially, the children were chosen based on the results of a survey especially developed for the study. Interviews and a drawing activity were used to collect the data that served as the basis for analysis. Analysis of the data indicates that students came from various family situations and socio-economic backgrounds, exhibited different communication styles, and described varied school experiences. They also exhibited an affinity for play, a tendency toward creativity, and the disposition of non-competitiveness. With regard to their information seeking behavior, informants indicated a variety of information seeking styles and interests, engaged in information seeking in order to facilitate maturation into their next developmental stage (adolescence), and recounted diverse and successful information seeking episodes. A point of passionexperience occurred in the lives of all of the informants, and the presence of ""anchor"" relationships helped in fostering their intrinsic motivation for information seeking. Students specified that interest/relevance of topic, working in a group, at least some choice in the task, creating a final product, and fewer time constraints are all components of intrinsically motivating information seeking episodes. Implications and recommendations for practitioners include suggestions for defining the missions, directing the services, and structuring the environments of school libraryprograms toward the goal of supporting and developing intrinsic motivation in school children.",Library Science,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nearly ninety percent of the schools' poetry collections were less than half the recommended size. Most of the poetry collections were near the fourteen-year age limit for a standards compliant school library collection, and circulation of poetry over one school year totaled less than one percent of the average library's circulation for that school year. Age of the poetry collection was a significant predictor of circulation, but size was not.

The variable for the Accountability Index was from the 2005-06 school year. School library media specialists across the state of Kentucky were asked to participate in a survey at www.surveymonkey.com.

The survey instrument used in the New Mexico impact study was adapted for this study as well as the instrument used by Dr. Paula Chambers for her dissertation research. Data were imported into SPSS for analysis. Descriptive and inferential statistical analysis of survey results found a significant difference in means scores for the average copyright year of video materials. Means scores were higher for schools that meet goals for number of books, number of reference materials, and copyright year of audio materials; however there was not sufficient evidence to support these variables had an impact on the 2005-06 Accountability Index.

The primary research question asked how the perceptions of teachers on the practices of the role of the school LMS differ from the way they perceive these roles to be important at their high schools. The secondary research questions addressed the correlations between high school teachers' demographic information and both the importance of and the practice of the roles of the high school LMS. Quantitative data were collected through a survey developed by McCracken. A paired-sample t test was used to compare the theoretical and practical scales in each category of the LMS roles and a Spearman rank-ordered correlations test was used to compare the 13 descriptive variables to theoretical and practical scales. Teacher participants reported each of the roles of the LMS to be more important than what is actually being practiced in their school settings and similar views on both the practice scale and importance scale. Institutes of higher education, professional development providers, and teacher organizations may benefit from having an awareness of the roles of the LMS for academic improvement at schools.

Specifically, the study contrasts two different hypermedia systems that contain resources on the Flint Sit-Down Strike, a complex historical domain. The experimental condition incorporates design features related to complexity, context-dependency and interconnectedness in order to highlight different aspects of its instructional content. The experimental condition was hypothesized to foster greater achievement on tests for synthesis, integration and retention of knowledge and to be more favorably rated by users. The control condition incorporates simple linear design features interface including several features that are antithetical to those of the experimental condition. The control condition presents the same instructional content in a more rigid and decontextualized manner and was hypothesized to foster greater mastery of factual recall but less synthesis, integration and retention of knowledge. Results however demonstrated that participants in the control condition were able to recall more facts, make more connections between themes in the test for synthesis and retain more facts in the test for retention than participants in the experimental condition. However, differences in overall performance for both hypermedia systems were not statistically significant as there was no difference in the number of facts cited in the test for factual integration or synthesis. Lastly, there was no significant difference in overall performance between the two conditions on the integration test.",information science,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The effective evidence-based high school librarian: a journey to decision,D/T,2008,"Turriff, Alison",Ph.D.,Robert Gordon University,,,,,,,,,,,,,United Kingdom,,,questionnaires,,,http://search.proquest.com/docview/1442504575/DB8412A786C2416APQ/89?accountid=14474,"This thesis aims to establish how high school librarians in Scotland and America can become effective evidence-based decision-makers. Initial data collection consisted of written questionnaires to elicit background data from librarians on the extent of their evidence-based practice. Three main themes emerged: collaboration; interprofessional relationships and roles; and decision-making. These themes are discussed in more detail. A range of qualitative methodologies was designed and implemented to gain more in-depth information on practice and viewpoints, involving librarians and stakeholders. A draft model was created of the effective evidence-based practitioner in a high school library, based on an interpretation of findings and readings from the literature. After member-checking and validating by stakeholders, a final model was produced. This emergent model focuses not on the role of the school librarian in isolation, but stresses the importance of interrelationships involving the librarian. The study makes an original contribution to knowledge by giving a better understanding of the effective evidence-based high school librarian in the wider context of education. There is also a contribution to knowledge by adding to the general theory of workplace decision-making and evidence-based practice which is applicable outwith the school sector, and the pragmatic solution-driven model of decision-making is introduced. Key findings give an insight into the complexity of the school library situation, and highlights that ideally there will be positive relationships between school management, school librarian and collaboration. When these come together, it can mean an increase in student achievement, and more effective evidence-based decisions can be made. Findings also demonstrate links between these elements with evidence, national bodies and skills and qualities needed to be an effective evidence-based high school librarian, and identify how the new and complex expectations made of school librarians can be met. Recommendations are made to help stakeholders improve practice.",Library Science,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The relationship between school culture and an effective school libraryprogram: Four case studies,D/T,2008,"Howard, Jody K.",Ph.D.,Emporia State University,,,,,,,,,,,,,United States,,,qualitative research,,,http://search.proquest.com/docview/304813411/abstract/904E0C363BCA4C58PQ/25?accountid=14474,"Standards establishing effective school library programs have been described inInformation Power: Building Partnerships for Learning (AASL & AECT, 1998), which calls on the librarian to act as an instructional partner with classroom teachers so that information skills instruction takes place within the context of ongoing classroom activity. However, some school librarians have been unable to implement this model. This begs the question, why are some librarians able to establish such programs while others fail? There is research literature in education that acknowledges the importance of school culture as a factor in instructional innovations. Yet this is not an issue that has been addressed to a great extent within the Library and Information Science (LIS) literature regarding school libraryprograms. Examining the culture in schools with effective school library programs may help to identify factors that support implementing the Information Power model. This dissertation describes a multiple case study of four K-12 schools. Each of the schools has received a national award recognizing the effectiveness of the library based on criteria established by the American Association of School Librarians (AASL). Giddens' structuration theory (1984), Senge's (1990) concepts of the learning organization, and Schein's (1992) theory of organizational culture provide the framework for this dissertation. The approach to analysis is consistent with the tenets of naturalistic research and reflects the assumptions of a qualitative research more generally. Common patterns found at each site include the presence of a collaborative culture, the collaborative leadership style of the principal, and high expectations for the students and staff. LIS professors may use these conclusions in the instruction of school library candidates. School librarians may use this data in aligning their programs with national standards. Future research includes replicating this study using a larger number of schools to determine if the same patterns will surface. Additional research needs to be conducted analyzing the role of culture in organizations, the influence of interactions among the major players in the schools, and the change process.",Library Science,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In spite of these findings, many school libraries today are undervalued and underutilized, often becoming the first victim of budget cuts. In Texas, as well as other states, the current debate over what should be considered a direct classroom instructional expense threatens the very existence of school libraries and librarians. If libraries are classified as educational support, many districts will no longer be able to afford library materials or certified librarians. This study reviews research citing the lack of support for school libraries, both philosophically and financially, from school principals. The author reports on the findings of a survey conducted to determine if school administrators believe that an effective school library program can increase student achievement. The author suggests that (a) further research into the beliefs of school administrators regarding the instructional role of the school library is necessary in order to facilitate full integration of school libraries into the instructional program through administrator/librarian collaboration, and (b) school librarians should conduct action research to identify the specific aspects of the school library program that contribute to academic achievement.",Library Science,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The synthesis of previously unrelated primary source materials and other emblematic professional publications provides an overview of the influences on evaluation of follitales published for youth and sheds light on the forces that impact library materials selection, collection development, and program design. In turn, these forces impact what children read, which impacts their world view. This research examines reviews of folktales published for youth from 1905-2000 in the ""Big Four"" major reviewing journals for children's collections in public libraries: Booklist, the Bulletin of the Center for Children's Books, Horn Book, and School Library Journal.Emblematic works addressing cultural authenticity, evaluation criteria, multiculturalism, and other issues places the evolution of the examined criteria in the context of its era by relating it to professional perceptions of children's services, possible social influences, and writings of practitioners for practitioners, which function as professional guideposts. Comparisons of twentieth-century reviews from library journals and other primary sources indicate an evolving consciousness among reviewers of the importance of issues related to the appraisal of traditional tales published for youth. Included transcripts of oral histories collected from current nd past book review editors of the ""Big Four"" journals focus on editorial perceptions about current and past criteria for evaluating folktales, the impact of multiculturalism on children's book publishing, and the effects of issues of cultural authenticity on children's book reviewing. Early twenty-first-century perceptions of acceptable criteria for evaluation of folktales are discussed, including the philosophical gap between mainstream and non-mainstream voices.",Library Science,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A review of the literature established 6 broad categories in which media specialists function. These broad categories include: program administration and management, collaboration/instructional partnership, information access and delivery, leadership, school improvement, and staff development. Specific activities within each of the broad categories were identified from the literature and from a focus group of active media specialists. Respondents included middle school personnel within one large suburban school district south of Atlanta who were surveyed online and asked to rank the activities in each broad category according to how they believed media specialists should devote their time and efforts. Results indicated that the program administration and management category was preferred by most of the respondents, with the activity of ordering appropriate materials seen as the most important within that category. Surveys were also analyzed according to the employment position of each respondent in the school community: classroom teacher, administrator, counselor, other school personnel, and media specialist. Findings suggested that classroom teachers possessed similar beliefs to school administrators. Few school counselors returned the survey which led the researcher to conclude that more needs to be done to establish a working relationship with the counseling department within the schools.

Of the state population of principals and certified librarians, the 275 school districts accounted for 988 of the 3,382 certified librarians (29.2 percent) and 1,941 of the 6,632 principals (29.3 percent). Both personnel groups were represented in each of the 20 Education Service Center regions.The survey response rate for the principals was 20.0 percent while the response rate for the certified librarians was 34.7 percent. The results were not generalized to the state population of principals and certified librarians because random sampling of the state population had not been possible. However, the demographic and employment characteristics of the response sample were comparable to those of the state population. Quantitative findings indicated the need for further research with regard to whether or not library media complaint procedures were duly followed during previous school years and whether or not conflict had occurred between the principals and the certified librarians as they implemented complaint procedures. The quantitative findings also indicated the need for further research with regard to library media complaints as reported by the two personnel groups and according to district enrollment size, county population size, and the three education levels. The study's qualitative findings supported the quantitative findings. Moreover, the study's qualitative findings indicated as well, that the principals and certified librarians' appreciation of selection policy and complaint procedures occasionally differed because of the principals' different legal perspective of library selection policy and complaint procedures. The qualitative findings suggested that the research emphasis for school censorship and school library policy and procedures should include consideration of legal due process, in addition to consideration of student First Amendment rights. Because of the principals' different legal perspective, the qualitative findings also suggested the need for further predictive analyses using the differing legal opinions as predictors of the principals and certified librarians' opinions of school library policy and complaint procedures.

The impact of West Tennessee elementary and middle school library media centers on Tennessee Comprehensive Assessment Program composite reading test scores,D/T,2006,"Crafford, Andre Davis",Ph.D.,Union University,,,,,,,,,,,,,United States,,,survey,,,http://search.proquest.com/docview/304913353/abstract/904E0C363BCA4C58PQ/20?accountid=14474,"There has been a decline in the amount of funding school libraries have received over the last decade. Due to funding issues, many schools have been forced to reduce the number of library media specialists or library staff, reduce the amount of books added to library collections, and in some extreme cases, schools have been forced to close school librarydoors. The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship of student academic achievement to variables related to the operation and supervision of school library media centers. The independent variables of school library media centers investigated were library collection size, library visits and book checkouts, and the services delivered by library media specialists in selected school library media centers throughout school districts in West Tennessee. Specifically, this study examined the dependent variable of standardized test scores in the area of Reading as measured on the Tennessee Comprehensive Assessment Program (TCAP) for students in grades 3, 5, and 8. The sample consisted of 47 West Tennessee elementary and middle schools libraries. These school libraries were associated with schools that contained students in grades 3, 5, and 8. The research questions explored were: (1) Does collection size (number of books, magazines, and audio-visual items) in aschool library media center affect the results of student performance as measured by Reading scores on the TCAP in schools located throughout West Tennessee? (2) Does the number of student visits to the library media center and the number of books checked out by students influence the reading achievement as measured by Reading scores on the TCAP of students in schools located throughout West Tennessee? And (3) Do the services performed by library media specialists impact student achievement as measured by Reading scores on the TCAP of students in schools located throughout West Tennessee? Supporting evidence was found to support the first research question that collection size does impact TCAP Composite Reading Test Scores. Results and further implications are discussed in detail in this study.",Library Science,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

According to these studies, effective school library media centers have: (a) a qualified library media specialist, (b) adequate support staff, (c) current and large collections, (d) access to information technology that is integrated into the curriculum, and (e) time for collaboration with the faculty. This study was developed to explore the role of technology in the collaborations between school library media specialists and teachers. Data revealed that interactions between school library media specialists and teachers concerning the use of technology to teach information literacy skills occurred with frequency and in a variety of ways at the three selected exemplary school library media centers. However, barriers sometimes prevented collaboration from resulting. Climate in theschool library media center was found to be crucial to collaboration and to the teaching of information literacy skills. Data indicated that technology should be only one of the tools used in teaching of information literacy skills to students, although computer literacy skills are perceived as increasingly important in this effort. According to the data from the surveys, interviews, and observations, teachers perceived the library media specialist to be the person with expertise in both technology and information literacy on their campuses, thereby necessitating involvement in continuing professional development. The findings of these best practices of technology interactions and the teaching of information fluency skills, as well as a thorough literature review, led to the formation of the Integrated Information Fluency Model for Student Learning.",Library Science,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A literature search revealed little relevant research onschool library evaluation. Most projects concentrated on managers' point of view rather than highlighting pupils' contribution to policy development. Guidelines published by the Library Association, the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities and the Scottish Consultative Council on the Curriculum were studied for information on research bases and on suggestions for pupil input but it was found that neither aspect was given significant emphasis. There was little guidance on appropriate methodology in the documents dealing with school libraries. Higher education projects yielded more helpful information and it was decided to use the Multiple Constituencies/ Stakeholder method which was already tested in New Zealand and the UK. A qualitative approach, this incorporates some quantitative methods which are used to indicate customers' preferences. Themes relevant to pupils' interests were identified by studying the published Standards and Guidelines and by individual interviews and discussion groups in six East Renfrewshire schools. 241 pupils completed a questionnaire consisting of 37 statements, each being rated on a scale of one to seven. The resulting data yielded information on preferences, from which factors important to pupils were extrapolated, including a comparison of views of younger and older pupils and of boys and girls. Many of the Guidelines' recommendations were acceptable to pupils but issues relating to the teaching of information skills, reading promotion and pupil involvement in library administration were less appropriate.",Library Science,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The importance of the study was that there is little known about the leadership role of the school librarymedia specialist and the role of the school library media specialist. Further, the literature concerning effective schools and effective school library media specialists is separate. The study had four conclusions. First, an effective school library media specialist can be the hub of the school. Second, the effective school library media specialist can lead from the middle through technology expertise, collaborative planning, promoting reading and positive public relations. Next, the effective school library media specialist is supported by the positive perceptions of the superintendent, school principal, library supervisor, and classroom teachers who all realize the importance of the school library media program to academic achievement. Even though the programs do not completely meet the standards, through the leadership that evolved from daily collaboration, the school library media specialists in this study managed to provide effective programs. Last, the school librarymedia specialists are enabled by the positive perceptions of the superintendent, scheduling and financial support from the school principal, the advocacy of the library supervisor, and the use of the center by teachers. However, constraints such as a lack of time for collaborative planning, lack of paraprofessional staff, inadequate funding and no substitutes for the school library media specialists constrain them.",Library Science,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Saudi Arabia recognises the importance of developing the learning environment and adopting modern concepts of learning. Teaching the 'Library and Research' instruction, the Schools' Net Project and the Learning Resource Centre Project are evidence of concern with facilitating learning through resource-based school libraries. In order to obtain information about the current situation of school libraries, questionnaires were distributed to schools and to administrative area managers. The overall response rate was 41.6 and 69.2% respectively. The survey results showed that school libraries generally are poor and school librarians neither skilled nor trained. School libraries generally have poor collections, an absence of full-time qualified librarians, a lack of IT, inadequate educational activities and insufficient funding. They therefore cannot be expected to play a significant role in the educational process. In contrast, the majority of school librarians, school managers and administrative area managers reported encouraging attitudes towards modern concepts of learning and school library media centres. Recommendations for development focus on three areas: the learning environment; the physical infrastructure of the school library and its resources; and the status and position of school librarians. The necessity of changing the traditional learning approach into a student-centred approach is stressed. To support such an approach, information skills should be introduced and IT should be considered an important method of accessing information. The role of the school library in the learning process also needs to be recognised and school librarians should be seen as an important part of the educational team. They should have appropriate qualifications in Library and Information Science and be able to access in-service training.

Multicultural materials increased in publication to address the change in perspectives. During the 1990s the anniversary of Columbus' voyage (1992) resulted in a surge in the number of children's books about American Indians. Debates concerning the accuracy of reviews of children's books about American Indians surfaced as library media specialists sought book reviews to identify books to support the curriculum. A content analysis was conducted of 1,841 children's book reviews and about American Indians published between 1990 and 2000. Reviews from 5 standard, 5 multicultural and 5 specialized American Indian tools along with review criteria were investigated. Review characteristics (new authors, established authors, American Indian authors, major & small press publishers, reviewer background, format, recommended, not recommended, average word count, and total reviews) in standard tools were compared with the same characteristics in multicultural and specialized tools. The data suggest a propensity toward convergence in coverage of reviews in standard and multicultural tools. The differences between standard review characteristics and multicultural review characteristics are 6% or less. When the characteristics in standard tools are compared with those in specialized American Indian tools, little convergence of coverage is found. The differences between standard and American Indian tools show a double digit difference ranging from a low of 10% to a high of 34%. When review criteria and background of reviewers is compared between standard, multicultural and specialized tools, the data suggest that multicultural tools serve as bridge between standard and specialized tools. The data suggest that standard tools do not provide criteria to reviewers to discern negative stereotypes of American Indians in children's books. The data comparing review criteria used by multicultural tools and specialized tools show guidance is given to reviewers to discern negative stereotypes in children's books. The research suggest that school library media specialists who need to identify the largest number of culturally accurate books by and about American Indians are best served by using multicultural and specialized American Indian selection tools.",Library Science,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The case study employed several data gathering tools: collection mapping, reflections of School Library Committee members, circulation analysis, and the researcher's reflective journal. The findings are shared in two formats: a month-by-month presentation analysis of key themes and an analysis according to the Van Orden collection program model. The vital position that collection development plays in the leadership role of the teacher-librarian was validated through this action research. The collaborative approach used resulted in several tangible benefits to the school library program, including a greater awareness by staff of the complexity of the teacher-librarian's role and an understanding of the value of having a school library committee for developing the school library program. Recommendations for possible actions, as well as suggestions for establishing supports to fully implement these recommendations are presented.",Elementary Education,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Teacher lesson plans were used to calculate the number of library visits for English and Social Studies class sections. Independent t-tests were used to compare mean differences in library use. The hypothesis, there is a significant difference in the amount of purposeful use of the school libraryduring the school day for a traditionally scheduled and for an A/B block scheduled school, was not supported. The results of the overall independent t-test indicated that there was no significant difference in overall library use between the traditionally scheduled and the block scheduled English and Social Studies class sections (p = .710) at the .05 level. To further explore purposeful library use, individual independent t-tests were conducted for each subject area, revealing that traditionally scheduled English I, II, and U.S. History class sections made significantly more library visits (p = .040; p = .034; p = .035) and A/B block scheduled English III, IV, and Geography class sections (p = .033; p = .012; p = .003) made a significantly greater number of library visits.

The study investigated the extent to which secondary school principals' assessment of the school libraryprogram's role and the teacher-librarian's role as defined in the Pennsylvania Standards for Library Certification and Practice converged or diverged from that of secondary teacher-librarians' assessment. Additionally, the study sought to ascertain secondary principals' and secondary teacher-librarians' assessment regarding the implementation of information literacy into the school's curriculum. The study provided both a descriptive and an inferential analysis of school library programs and teacher-librarians. The Statistical Package for the Social Sciences was used to analyze the data collected from the survey questionnaires. The probability for all tests of significance was set at .05. The study's major finding was that principals indicated the major role of teacher-librarians was in reference and research services, while teacher-librarians indicated their major role was instruction in information literacy; Other findings demonstrated: (1) the means for teacher-librarians were significantly higher than the means for principals on the following five library services: collection development and organization, integration of information with curricular content, reading guidance, staff development and training; and policy development; (2) there was a high degree of consistency between the rankings of specific library services from both groups (.864); (3) there was no significant difference in the quality of communication between principals and teacher-librarians; (4) both principals and teacher-librarians agreed that the primary challenge that faced the library program was lack of money; (5) both principals and teacher-librarians indicated increased staff development was needed to integrate information literacy into the curriculum; (6) principals named lack of funding as the major barrier to the implementing and integrating information literacy into the curriculum, while teacher-librarians named negative teacher attitudes and a lack of understanding of the role of the teacher-librarian as an instructional partner as major barriers. Based on the study's Keystone finding that principals rarely recognized the instructional role of the teacher-librarian, several implications for improving practice, policy and leadership were discussed.",Library Science,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The study answers two core questions. The first question identifies the issues that librarians believe need to be addressed in order for them to be able to manage multimedia resources successfully. The second question identifies those strategies that librarians already use to manage this technology and this empirical evidence has produced a set of recommendations. The study also provides an evaluation of the methodology used to conduct this study. Both the strengths and weaknesses of the research tools employed are identified. The methodological approach employed was found to be particularly suitable for gathering the concerns, perceptions and opinions of secondary school librarians.Firstly, the study provides an overview of the relationship between IT, school libraries and education. Secondly, qualitative data from a questionnaire on CD-ROMs and the Internet is analysed. The responses from Nottinghamshire school librarians form the basis of this study. To evaluate whether the trends identified are representative across the region, a comparison is then conducted with the responses gained from school librarians from two neighbouring counties. Thirdly, qualitative data gained from Focus Groups and Interviews undertaken by Nottinghamshire librarians is examined. This data reflects both the group and individual perspective on the issues discussed.The survey reveals the structure of the communication network that exists between the school librarian and teachers and also with other school library professionals. The study shows that the librarian needs to be both proactive and flexible to accommodate teachers' needs in relation to IT training and usage. The introduction of the Internet into the library provides an opportunity for the librarian to expand his/her role, and increase his/her status, within the school community. In order for this to be successful problems relating to access, supervision and pupil information retrieval skills need to be resolved.",Library Science,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Professional organizations and associations have set standards and issued guidelines from the early days of the profession and revised the standards on a regular basis. Yet, despite the issuance of national standards there is insecurity and confusion among librarians regarding their role. Therefore this study seeks to determine if practicing school librarians have been able to implement the 1988 and 1998 national standards and if they think it is important to implement the standards at their school. This study also attempts to determine if there is a correlation between descriptive variables (level of school. i.e. elementary or secondary, the number of years of professional experience as a school library media specialist, the number of years experience as a classroom teacher, the amount of available technology, the presence of an automated circulation and cataloging system, and the type of scheduling that the librarian uses, flexible, fixed, or a combination), and the reported practices and views of school library media specialists. A historical review of the literature revealed that school librarians have been asked to assume a wide variety of roles and that there has been confusion in the profession regarding the role of the school librarian. To determine what the perceptions of school librarians are regarding their roles and practices the researcher has developed a survey. The survey is comprised of statements regarding the roles of the school library media specialist as described in the 1988 and 1998 editions ofInformation Power . For each statement respondents are asked to answer the following questions, ""Do you practice this?"" and ""Do you think this is an important part of the school library media specialist's role?"" The survey will be mailed to a random sampling of 1,000 K-12 school library media specialists in the United States. The random sampling will be obtained from Market Data Retrieval, an educational marketing firm.

Because, in Alberta, education, including school library programs, is the mandate of local jurisdictions, great inequity has resulted in the quality of resource collections, library facilities, technology, and professional and technical leadership and services to which students and teachers have access.
