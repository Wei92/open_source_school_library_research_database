This theory contradicts traditional information theory which contends that information-seeking behaviour is a complex activity that is affected by cultural, educational and social contexts. Anecdotal evidence from schools and public libraries has long suggested that while young people actively use technology, they do not use it as described by the Net generation theorists. In recent years there has been an emerging body of research on the Net Generation that largely debunks the myth of an intuitive user who is capable of using electronic resources to find information, a fact many teacher librarians have long suspected. This paper explores the initial findings of research into the information-seeking behaviour of young adults and how they use a range of technologies and electronic resources.

The setting was an automated library of a private American school in Europe. Ten biology students were chosen by purposive sampling. Selection criteria, monitored by user profiles, included student age, computer experience, native language, grades, and test scores. \r\nOne group used concept mapping, while the other received the same classroom instruction without mapping. Data on searching behavior were collected using think-alouds, interviews, debriefing, and journals. Calculations based on Bayesian statistics and the Fano measure from information theory were triangulated with qualitative analysis of data. While the entire research process, as defined by Kuhlthau’s model, was examined to include stages from pre-focus formulation to writing the research paper, this article centers on the information search. Fano’s information measures showed there was a greater probability that concept mappers will use print rather than electronic means, that they will search in SIRS rather than the OPAC, and that in electronic searching they will use subject heading rather than keyword. In print, as opposed to electronic searching, measures showed mappers applied a larger number of search terms, employed opening moves, re-formulations, search operations, and relevancy judgments more often and executed more depth than breadth searching. In all cases probability measured at least half a nat (one nat equals 2.718), indicating chances were approaching twice as likely that searchers exhibiting these characteristics in print indexes will be mappers. Larger differences between the groups emerged in electronic searching, where mappers spent less time. \r\n\r\nQuantitative data verified mappers were more thorough and efficient, reformulating by shifting synonyms and moving from general to specific search terms and terminating searches to read rather than when they depleted their search terms. Stronger focus formulation emerged as the most important determinant of searching behavior.

The final product is unique to the creator and the institution that assigns it. In preparation for implementing portfolio assessment in the Master of Library Science program at a regional university, a careful review of schools requiring portfolios was conducted to identify commonalities among programs. Analysis of documents available at Web sites were carefully examined for the following characteristics: portfolio required or optional; required reflective writings; artifacts aligned with state and national standards; artifacts aligned with program objectives; evaluation rubrics provided; evaluation by reviewing committee; periodic review with an advisor; and statement of main goal or purpose for the portfolio. Following this review, it was determined that at least fourteen ALA-accredited programs use portfolio assessment for evaluation of student performance in their library program of studies, the majority of which are in school library media. The common characteristics include: artifacts aligned with state and national standards, required written reflections, and faculty advisors to mentor students through the process. Following the first year of portfolio assessment in our program, we have concluded that the continual process of self-examination, comparison to standards, and personal assessment of students’ products provided rich learning experiences aligned with program goals and objectives.','MLIS Education','','','0',NULL),(116,'Methods for Measuring the Influence of  Concept Mapping on Student Information  Literacy','R',2002,'Carol A.

The method employed, analysis of title ownership through examination of the school’s OPAC, was an attempt to move away from questionnaires and interviews which might not allow for an objective description of selection decisions and acquisition practices.\r\nA pool of recent, potentially controversial young adult books that had also received supporting reviews, awards, or recommendations for inclusion on reading lists was established. A small, random sample of high schools in Texas that are part of the state’s online union catalog system was determined. Specific titles were searched in each school’s OPAC to determine ownership. \r\nBased on one factor, not owning at least 50 percent of the controversial titles in the pool tested, the researcher concludes that over 80 percent of the schools in the study show signs that self-censorship has occurred during the collection development process.

The Big Six information skills model (Big6) is one that is primarily aimed at kindergarten through twelfth-grade students. This model is intended to foster the acquisition of research, problem-solving, and metacognitive skills through the cooperation of both school library media specialists and classroom teachers. While a strong anecdotal record exists supporting the use of Big6, empirical research support is less evident in library and education literature. This study examines the effect of Big6 on a class of eighth-grade students asked to research and write about events surrounding the African-American Civil Rights movement. This study describes the context of the task students were asked to complete, student’s experiences and reactions, and some conclusions that might be drawn from their experiences. It is a study based on a very small and homogenous set of students, but it tends to show the value of concise models that illustrate the full problem-solving process in order for young “researchers” to perhaps more fully grasp the extent of the task facing them.

The purpose of this study is twofold: (1) to interrogate a middle school’s information literacy assessment system for internal disturbances (tensions and contradictions) between system elements that restrict the SLMS’s ability to assess information literacy; and (2) to design a technology -based instrument that addresses these system disturbances and enables SLMSs to expand their assessment roles. The researcher used rapid design ethnography coupled with an activity theory (AT) -based analysis to produce an indepth description of the assessment system disturbances. A technology-based assessment instrument was then designed and developed to address the system disturbances. The ethnographic methods and AT analysis informed the design and development of a Virtual Reality Information Literacy Learning and Assessment Space (VILLAS). VILLAS addresses the four primary assessment disturbances illuminated in recent library literature in addition to the site-specific disturbances identified in this study, and it has the potential to decrease the distance between the librarian’s assessment roles as envisioned in theory and as realized in practice.','IL instruction and  assessment','','','0',NULL),(123,'The Ideal Candidate for School Library  Media Specialist: Views from School  Administrators, Library School Faculty, and  MLS Students','R',2004,'Nadine K.

The amount of reading that a child does is directly related to reading fluency; the more one reads, the more proficient one becomes. After reviewing theories and research studies investigating why boys perform less well than girls, a consensus emerges that one reason boys read less is because the kind of reading they are given to do in school does not connect to their interests. A small empirical study in one rural elementary school provides further insight into motivations for reading and non-reading by both boys and girls. The evidence is incontrovertible that as a group, school-age boys score lower than girls at every level on standardized tests of reading comprehension, in almost every country where tested, most notably in the United States (NCES 2002), Canada, England, and Australia, where students are continuously tested. Therefore, the obvious conclusion from this data is that we are failing to make readers of our sons. Analyses of statistics are many and controversial, especially as the latest round of “educational reform” fueled by the Education Act of 2001 has generated more high-stakes testing of students and measurable accountability on the part of teachers, schools, and school districts. Additionally, computers have made gathering, storing, and analyzing statistics simpler than ever before, and the Internet has made it easier to publish and retrieve them.

Quantitative and qualitative analyses of the results of an online survey and ten in-depth interviews measuring use of specific online tools (i.e., search engines, specific Web sites, digital libraries, online periodical databases, and electronic discussion lists) were conducted. Key findings show that teachers are using a greater number and wider range of current and multimodal resources than pre-Internet and perceive this as an advantage in creating authentic, inquiry-based learning experiences. However, underuse of educational online resources specifically designed to support teaching and learning activities (e.g., digital libraries, online periodical databases, and electronic discussion lists) was evidenced.

The subjects were a group of student librarians--themselves experienced teachers--as they attempted to foster collaborative information literacy activities with selected teachers in their host schools.(Note: The term “student librarian” is the official term applied within the institutional setting in which the research occurred.) The investigators instructed these student librarians to base their approaches on social marketing theory and practice. In addition, the investigators acquired data about collaboration processes from two focus groups made up of experienced teachers, who responded to a set of questions designed to measure teacher predictability to engage in collaboration. Findings indicated that collaboration is expensive, involving investments of time, resources, and human interactions within complex systems of institutional culture and personal expectations. Although complex, social marketing principles are integrated throughout the collaboration process; they signal that school library media specialists, as marketers of a socially useful service, need to build trust for themselves and promote the collaborative process as a socially and professionally rewarding activity. Toward this end, school library media specialists-as-marketers have the responsibility for developing a social market environment conductive to collaboration between teachers and school library media specialist.','information seeking','marketing','','0',NULL),(137,'School Libraries and Science Achievement: A View from Michigan ’s Middle Schools','R',2007,'Marcia Mardis ','Assistant Professor',' in the Library and Information Science Program at Wayne State University ','','','','','','','','','','','','','USA','Wayne State University','Detroit','Survey','','','http://www.ala.org/aasl/sites/ala.org.aasl/files/content/aaslpubsandjournals/slr/vol10/SLMR_SchoolLibScienceAchievement_V10.pdf',' If strong school library media centers (SLMCs) positively impact middle school student reading achievement, as measured on standardized tests, are they also beneficial for middle school science achievement? To answer this question, the researcher built upon the statistical analyses used in previous school library impact studies with qualitative measures in an attempt to discover relationships between science education and school library media programs. Taking into account major external predictors of student achievement, the researcher examined usage, staffing, collection, technology, and budgetary school library media program variables. She found that 2002 eighth-grade Michigan Educational Assessment Program (MEAP) science test scores had a significant positive relationship only with the size of the SLMC video collection. In subsequent qualitative follow-up activity, participants emphasized the importance of providing video in their services to science educators, as well as their challenges in providing high-quality, current science collections. Participants also pointed to teacher collaboration as a primary but underutilized way of improving their link with science teachers. The results of this study imply that while school library media specialists ably furnish science teachers and students with multimedia resources, due to systemic and professional factors, they are not yet consistently and confidently poised to be science collaborators.','best practice in IL','','','0',NULL),(138,'Information and communication technology use by North Carolina School Library Media Specialist Perceived competencies and barriers','R',2008,'Sandra Hughes-Hassell','Associate Professor','School of Information and Library Science','Dana Hanson-Baldauf','Doctoral student','School of Information and Library Science','','','','','','','','','','USA','University of North Carolina','Chapel Hill ','questionnaire','','','http://www.ala.org/aasl/sites/ala.org.aasl/files/content/aaslpubsandjournals/slr/vol11/SLMR_InformationCommunication_V11.pdf','Given the interdisciplinary and information-rich nature of information and communication technologies (ICTs), many advocate for school library media specialists (SLMSs) to take a leadership role in promoting their integrative use across the K–12 curriculum.

This report compares findings across a subset of data collected in three independent research studies focusing on students’ conceptions and perceptions of how they have learned what they know about information literacy. Competency theory, which posits that low-skilled individuals in some knowledge domains are often unable to recognize their deficiencies and therefore tend to overestimate their abilities, is used as the theoretical framework in each study. Data on participants’ previous experiences with information literacy instruction was collected through surveys or interviews. A majority of students reported that they were largely self-taught, but some also reported having received instruction from school library media specialists (SLMSs) and, to a lesser degree, public and academic librarians. Overall, low\r\n-performing students tended to identify peers as sources of knowledge while proficient students tended to identify SLMSs and teachers as sources of knowledge.

Principals form their views on the basis of both negative and positive interactions with library media specialists and base their expectations of their current and future library media specialists on these prior experiences and expectations. Another key finding was that principals place primary responsibility for initiation of collaboration at both the individual teacher level and the school level with the library media specialist.

These activities may close the library media center to regular patron use for all or part of the school day. This study surveyed school library media specialists in two states and examined the reasons that school library media centers are closed as well as the effect of the closure on circulation. Results indicate that the three most commonly reported reasons for closure of the school library media center were preparation for the end of the school year, book fairs, and standardized testing.

An electronic survey was used to collect data from matriculating LIS students. The survey contained a Likert scale measuring three areas of cultural competence: self-awareness, education, and interaction. A gap-analysis technique was employed to detect discrepancies between students’ prior knowledge and actual learning relative to cultural competence.

The study’s perspective was sociocultural, and grounded theory was adopted as the method. This paper presents a critical evaluation of the advantages and limitations of grounded theory. The key findings of the study are outlined and discussed. The findings are related to the extent to which students valued information literacy practices and the factors involved in determining whether students were likely to transfer information literacy practices across time and school subjects. The study identified three groups of students: (1) a minority, who were engaged in their own learning, valued information literacy practices, and were likely to transfer these practices; (2) a majority, who could potentially be engaged in their own learning and who valued information literacy practices in principle, but were unlikely to transfer these practices without intervention by a teacher or teacher librarian; and (3) a very small minority, who failed to grasp the concepts of learning or information literacy practices and could not transfer such practices. The study also found that the lack of a culture of transfer \r\nin the schools was a significant hindrance in developing students as transferrers.

Members of the groups identified twelve motivators and five barriers to sexual-health information provision in high school libraries, both supporting and further contributing to previous findings of related research.','librarian\'s role','','','0',NULL),(159,'Assessing Information Literacy: A Case  Study of Primary 5 Students in Hong Kong','R',2012,'Samuel Kai Wah Chu ','','The University of Hong Kong, Pokfulam, Hong Kong','','','','','','','','','','','','','Hong Kong','Th University of Hong Kong','Pokfulam','Survey','','','http://www.ala.org/aasl/sites/ala.org.aasl/files/content/aaslpubsandjournals/slr/vol15/SLR_AssessingInformationLiteracy_V15.pdf','This paper reports an exploratory investigation of the information-literacy levels of primary 5 students in Hong Kong. Factors such as gender and reading ability were also examined. Primary 5 students from four local schools completed a fourteen-item information-literacy assessment (ILA), which was adopted and modified from questions on the sixth-grade version of the Tool for Real-time Assessment of Information Literacy Skills (TRAILS). The ILA covered five TRAILS categories and three American Association of School Librarians (AASL) and Association for Educational Communications and Technology (AECT) IL standards to measure different aspects of information literacy. Reading ability was measured by questions from a local public test of reading comprehension. On average, the participants (n = 199) achieved a mean score of 9.12 (SD = 2.56), and most assessment items showed room for improvement. Female students (n = 97; 48.7 percent) scored higher on the ILA than their male counterparts (n = 102; 51.3 percent), suggesting female students’ higher level of information literacy. Results also revealed a positive and significant relationship between students’ information literacy and reading ability.

This exploratory study, grounded in- lived practice (Spillane, Hunt, and Healey, 2009) uses reflective analysis to amplify competencies and skill development in pre-service school library education. The project positions graduate students and fifth-grade students as teachers and learners, and challenges pre-service school librarians to learn to teach by reflecting upon professional practice during their field experience. In this case study pre-service school librarians reflect-in-action, reflect-on-action (D.

RtI is supported with federal funds from the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act and federal Race to the Top grant funding. School districts nationwide are adopting RtI. For this study school librarians in schools that practice RtI participated in an online survey. Results indicate that seven processes are needed to implement RtI programs. Sixty-two percent of the surveyed librarians have a role in one or more of these processes. The school librarian’s involvement differs depending on which processes are supported. Data demonstrate that, in support of RtI activities, librarians have opportunities to lead and assist teachers and to impact student achievement through each of the seven processes: getting started, training staff, planning interventions, assessing students, scheduling interventions, implementing interventions, and evaluating the RtI program.','services to people with disabilities','','','0',NULL),(162,' School Librarians as Ambassadors of Inclusive Information Access for Students with Disabilities','C',2013,'Mega Subramaniam','','University of Maryland, College of Information Studies','Rebecca Oxley','','University of Maryland, College of Information Studies ','Christie Kodama ','','Highland Elementary School, Montgomery County Public Schools, Maryland','','','','','','','USA','University of Maryland','Maryland','observation','interview','','http://www.ala.org/aasl/sites/ala.org.aasl/files/content/aaslpubsandjournals/slr/vol16/SLR_SchoolLibrariansasAmbassadorsofInclusiveInformationAccess_V16.pdf','Many scholarly studies investigating school library services provided to students with special needs primarily address aspects of collaboration with special education (SPED) teachers in an immersed school environment.

We formulated this study to determine: 1) the types of facilities, services, and resources SLPs provide to students with specific disabilities in these SPED schools; 2) the technologies that facilitate physical and intellectual access for these students within the school library; 3) the extent to which federal disability guidelines are implemented in the design and delivery of these SLPs; and 4) the specialized training that enables school librarians to better support students with special needs. Our findings suggest that, if adequate pre-service and in-service training is provided and pertinent support is received from outside and inside of school, school librarians, as ambassadors of accessibility, can and do play a highly influential role in empowering students and staff in SPED schools.','services to people with disability','professional development','','0',NULL),(163,'Information Literacy and High School Seniors: Perceptions of the Research Process','C',2013,'Cindy Kovalik','Assistant Professor','School of Lifespan Development and Educational Sciences, Kent State University','Susan Yutzey','Director ','Learning Center, Upper Arlington High School, Upper Arlington, Ohio','Laura Piazza ','Librarian',' Upper Arlington High School, Upper Arlington, Ohio','','','','','','','USA','Kent State University','Pennsylvania','survey','','','http://www.ala.org/aasl/sites/ala.org.aasl/files/content/aaslpubsandjournals/slr/vol16/SLR_Information_Literacy_High_School_Seniors_V16.pdf','To better understand how high school students apply their information literacy skills when\r\nconducting research and how these students carry out research projects, researchers asked a\r\ngroup of 289 high school seniors to complete an information literacy survey related to the\r\nresearch process.

In addition, they described their own experiences in collaborating with teachers and/or librarians, as well as their views on where collaboration was taught in their respective curricula, where it could be taught, and how it might be taught most effectively. Findings indicate that while education faculty members tend to have a broader view of LIS than do LIS faculty and see education and LIS as having largely overlapping concerns, collaboration is more likely to be a topic of discussion in LIS classes than in education classes.

Based on this conceptual framework, we highlight how four middle school librarians in a large school district in the mid-Atlantic region of the United States enact and expand their five roles—information specialist, instructional partner, teacher, program administrator, and leader—while they participate in Sci-Dentity, a science-infused after-school program. We observed clear links between skills, dispositions, and responsibilities from the Standards, taught and facilitated by these school librarians, to principles in the Framework.

Yet, reading among adolescents has been in decline in recent years while engagement with audiobooks has increased. Professionals in librarianship, children’s literature, and literacy education have long promoted the educational benefits of transacting with audiobooks. Critics, however, contest the idea that listening to an audiobook can serve as a legitimate form of reading. This paper reviews the literature on audio delivery of content to three distinct participant groups: adolescents with visual impairments or learning disabilities, adolescent second language learners, and typically developing adolescents. Findings from the studies of audio delivery of content are mixed, and great variability in outcomes have been reported, depending on the characteristics of the groups studied. Numerous gaps exist in the research surrounding adolescents’ use of audiobooks, including examinations of the effectiveness of commercially produced audiobooks and explorations of adolescents’ listening preferences.

We used a mixed-methods design for data collection and analysis. We examined records\r\nof users’ database activities for the usage patterns of students and teachers. Surveys and phone\r\ninterviews were conducted to assess their perceptions of the usefulness of the electronic database\r\nfor learning and teaching. The Revised Two-Factor Learning Process Questionnaire (R-LPQ-\r\n2F) was employed to assess students’ learning approaches and their associations with news\r\ndatabase use, and perceptions were examined. Findings revealed that younger students tended\r\nexclusively to browse, while older students and teachers used both browsing and keyword\r\nsearching. Use patterns also confirmed that the news database provided accessibility to a vast\r\namount of information. Both students and teachers perceived the electronic database to be useful\r\nfor learning and teaching. Finally, we found that a deep learning approach was associated with\r\nfrequency of use and positive perceptions of the usefulness of the electronic database.

The relationship of these perceptions was studied to determine whether the level of endorsement was the same as the level of implementation for each of the nine beliefs, four standards, and each item in the four strands for each standard. The relationship between the level of endorsement of the beliefs and the standards was studied to determine whether this level was the same for the beliefs and the standards. Also studied were the relationships between the level of implementation of the beliefs and standards to determine whether each was perceived as implemented at the same level. The demographic data collected about each respondent included years of service as a school library media specialist, years of prior teaching experience, school level (elementary, middle, or high), and membership in school library organizations (state or national). Each item in the four strands of the four standards was studied to see whether there was a relationship between the overlying standard and strands, which consist of skills, dispositions in action, responsibilities, and self-assessment. The data were analyzed using nonparametric statistical methods. The level of endorsement was found to be significantly higher than the level of implementation for almost all of the beliefs, standards, and strands found in AASL\'s Standards for the 21st-Century Learner.

A survey was sent to 1703 principals in Oklahoma, and Library Media Improvement Program participants were interviewed.\r\n\r\nData analyses were conducted in three primary phases: descriptive statistics and frequencies were disaggregated to examine mean scores as they related to money spent on school library media programs; opinions of school library media programs; and possible relationships between school library media programs and student academic achievement. Analysis of variance was used in the second phase of data analysis to determine if any variation between means was significant as related to Oklahoma Library Improvement Grants, time spent in the library media center by the library media specialist, principal gender, opinions of library media programs, student achievement indicators, and the region of the state in which the respondent was located. The third phase of data analysis compared longitudinal data collected in the 2000 survey with past data.\r\n\r\nThe primary results indicated students in schools with a centralized library media center, served by a full-time library media specialist, and the school having received one or more Library Media Improvement Grants scored significantly higher than students in schools not having a centralized library media center, not served by a full-time library media specialist, and the school not having received one or more Library Media Improvement Grants.

Despite findings linking school library programming, including instruction by professional school librarians, to increased student achievement on standardized tests and improved content learning through student inquiry using library resources, the importance of the instructional role of the school librarian remains largely unrecognized by administrators and teachers.\r\n\r\nA qualitative case study of one rural Iowa elementary school provided insight into the issue of small schools without library programs as they are preparing to meet the Iowa reinstatement of the requirement for school library programs. The site was purposefully chosen because it has been operating without a school library program or professional teacher librarian district-wide. All 8 teachers from one elementary school and the non-endorsed library associate and the 4 district administrators participated in a focus group or semi-structured interviews. Related documents were consulted. The study explored the stakeholders\' perceptions and expectations regarding school library programs. Three themes emerged from the data exemplifying the expectations surrounding this school\'s library program: (a) a minimal role for school library programs in the vision and reality of participants, (b) the invisibility of the professional qualifications and instructional and collaborative qualities of the teacher librarian needed to increase program sustainability; and (c) a disconnect between the school library program and literacy, technology, and other curricular area school improvement initiatives. Implications for the importance of physical and intellectual access to school library collections and information skills instruction, integrated with an inquiry approach to learning, to a democratic education are discussed.

The purpose of this nonexperimental research was to examine the perceptions of state-certified teachers regarding LMS. Using collaboration and social constructivist learning theories, teachers at 3 high schools in Georgia were interviewed regarding the roles and responsibilities of LMS. The primary research question asked how the perceptions of teachers on the practices of the role of the school LMS differ from the way they perceive these roles to be important at their high schools. The secondary research questions addressed the correlations between high school teachers\' demographic information and both the importance of and the practice of the roles of the high school LMS. Quantitative data were collected through a survey developed by McCracken. A paired-sample t test was used to compare the theoretical and practical scales in each category of the LMS roles and a Spearman rank-ordered correlations test was used to compare the 13 descriptive variables to theoretical and practical scales. Teacher participants reported each of the roles of the LMS to be more important than what is actually being practiced in their school settings and similar views on both the practice scale and importance scale. Institutes of higher education, professional development providers, and teacher organizations may benefit from having an awareness of the roles of the LMS for academic improvement at schools. Social change implications include community and educator awareness of the role of the school LMS, an increased educator awareness of the roles of a state-certified school LMS to compliment the high school curriculum, and an increased awareness for the need of a school LMS in public school settings.','Library science','Secondary education;','Curriculum development','0','3379841'),(422,'A study of West Virginia secondary public school library media centers and library media specialists and their use of 21st century technology tools','DT',2008,'Sigman, Kimberly Ann Bickel','Ed.D.','Marshall University','','','','','','','','','','','','','United States','Marshall University,','United States','self-reporting mailed survey ','','','http://login.ezproxy.library.ualberta.ca/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/304337153?accountid=14474','Twenty-first century learning, learning that teaches global and wellness awareness, and civic and business literacy, is essential for students to become vital, contributing members of society. In order for students to participate in an environment of 21st century learning, the attainment of 21st century skills is essential. Twenty-first century skills encourage students to collaborate, communicate, critically think, and reflect. Such skills involve the use of technology tools—21st century tools—which include computers, Internet, production software, and communication processes. Literature establishes school library media centers as sites where students find many types of 21st century tools. Staffed by school library media specialists, school library media centers should be the hub of 21st century learning. It therefore becomes necessary to ascertain the types of 21st century tools available in school library media centers, how confident school library media specialists are in using the tools, and how often school library media specialists help students use the tools so that effective learning can occur.\r\n\r\nThis study utilized a researcher developed self-reporting mailed survey to conduct research with all 227 secondary school library media specialists in West Virginia. The study found that school library media specialists have reasonable level of access to 14 of 24 technology tools. The other 10 are absent in more than half of the West Virginia secondary school library media centers. The majority of West Virginia school library media specialists indicated they are extremely confident in using many 21st century technology tools; however they never assist students in using most of the tools. Ancillary findings showed increased incidences of technology training for school library media specialists increase the presence of technology tools in school library media centers, raise the confidence level of school library media specialists in using technology tools, and increase the frequency of assisting students with technology tools.','Library science','Educational technology','','0','3326237'),(423,'Digital libraries in schools: The best practices of National Board certified library media specialists','DT',2009,'Massey, Sheri Anita','Ph.D.','University of Maryland, College Park','','','','','','','','','','','','','United States','University of Maryland, College Park','United States','interviewes',' collect artifacts','thematic analysis','http://login.ezproxy.library.ualberta.ca/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/304921446?accountid=14474','This study investigated the digital library integration behaviors of school library media specialists (SLMSs) who have achieved certification from the National Board for Professional Teaching Standards (NBPTS). A qualitative interview study design was chosen to convert tacit knowledge related to digital library use into explicit knowledge that can be shared with others. The goal of this research was to identify behaviors and techniques that exemplary SLMSs share when using digital libraries to support the curriculum in K-12 schools.\r\n\r\nThe researcher interviewed and collected artifacts from 10 local National Board certified SLMSs and analyzed the resulting transcripts and materials using thematic analysis. A preliminary coding scheme was derived from the NBPTS\r\n\r\nLibrary Media technology innovation standard, which requires candidates to demonstrate expertise in providing technology access, teaching effective technology use, engaging learners with technology, and using technology to enhance the curriculum. Themes related to these four areas emerged from the data, as did subthemes in the form of barriers the SLMSs encountered and strategies they developed to meet the standard. The barriers are discussed using Ertmer\'s (1999) first- and second-order classifications. The strategies are the SLMSs\' best practices.\r\n\r\nTo provide digital library access the SLMSs made themselves and their assistants available to learners; demonstrated mental and resource flexibility when they encountered obstacles; and, implemented creative funding strategies. To teach digital library use they used the research process to help students bridge knowledge learned in various contexts; provided training; remained abreast of digital library innovations; and, offered suggestions to product developers. To maintain engagement with digital libraries they used proven teaching techniques that build on strong instructional design principles. Finally, they relied on collaborative relationships when integrating digital libraries. They increased collaboration by building trust among colleagues; extending their reach beyond the SLMC in person and virtually, diversifying their role within the school, and gathering curriculum information to incorporate information literacy skills into lessons.\r\n\r\nKey implications: encourage SLMS-teacher collaboration, build a knowledge management system that captures expertise and supports SLMS communication, reconsider blocking social networking tools in schools to bridge the disconnect between students\' home and school information-related behaviors.\r\n\r\nDetails','Library science','Educational technology;','Information science','0','3359753'),(424,'A study of the library use practices of high school students in three east Tennessee counties','DT',2002,'Clabo, Carrie Anna','Ed.D.',' East Tennessee State University','','','','','','','','','','','','','United States',' East Tennessee State University','United States','survey ','interview ','qualitative clarification','http://login.ezproxy.library.ualberta.ca/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/304802669?accountid=14474','The purpose of the study was to examine how and why high school students use the library and its resources. It examined how teachers influence students\' use of library resources. The participants were 11th-grade students attending public high schools in 3 east Tennessee counties. Participants completed a survey based on library use. Although 350 students were invited to participate in the study, only 130 returned the permission slip, resulting in a 37% response rate. Eleven respondents were asked to participate in a short interview to supplement and add qualitative clarification to the findings. The findings were descriptive in nature, although basic analyses were calculated to identify any relationships between the different variables.\r\n\r\nA literature review examined the historical development of the library, the purpose of the library, challenges to the role of the library, research in the library science field, influences on library use, library use and academic achievement, studies of library users and nonusers, and lifestyle variables relating to library use.\r\n\r\nThe study\'s identification of library use patterns and high school students\' attitudes about their use of the library could assist librarians in making long-range plans for their libraries. These plans could include the identification of materials to purchase, areas in which students need assistance in completing projects, or recreational materials to read. Ultimately, the findings could assist librarians in the development of cooperative programs between school and public libraries to reduce the overlapping of information while increasing student use of the library.\r\n\r\nThe study found most students visited the library at an early age with their mothers, although not on a regular basis. They were more likely to visit the school library than the public library; the primary reason being to locate information to complete school assignments. Parents and English teachers were the most influential in encouraging library use, although teachers had more influence on female students than male students. Female students also visited the library on a more frequent basis.','Library science;','Secondary education','','0','3042412'),(425,'The principal and the K-12 school library: A Delphi study','DT',2015,'Pickett, Janie A','Ed.D.','Sam Houston State University','','','','','','','','','','','','','United States','Sam Houston State University','United States',' online questionnaire','','','http://login.ezproxy.library.ualberta.ca/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1727739714?accountid=14474','Purpose\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this study was to describe the knowledge, skills, and dispositions used by the effective K-12 principal to facilitate a strong library program.

This mixed methods study investigated the practice of outcomes assessment at master’s programs in library and information studies accredited by the American Library Association in the United States and Canada. Six salient themes emerged from the survey responses of Accreditation Liaison officers and the content analysis of 12 program presentations of MLIS programs. First, outcomes assessment has taken hold at MLIS programs in which 93% of programs have adopting a common set of learning goals and outcomes, whereas 79% developed a written assessment plan. Second, accreditation is the primary driver for MLIS assessment efforts, while program directors, faculty, and assessment and curriculum committees provide leadership in its practice. Third, MLIS programs employed a diverse range of tools for measuring learning outcomes. Course assignment, course evaluation, rubric, internship rating, portfolios, and surveys are the most commonly used direct and indirect measures. Fourth, MLIS programs applied assessment results extensively for improving program, curriculum, course, and instruction; enhancing student services; and preparing for accreditation. Fifth, MLIS programs conduct outcomes assessment with limited resources. Two-thirds of the MLIS programs surveyed have no dedicated assessment personnel to support assessment efforts. Sixth, MLIS programs and faculty recognized the intrinsic values of assessment and accreditation. The findings suggest that MLIS programs can sustain assessment efforts by combining direct and indirect assessment measures, providing adequate faculty support, and further integrating assessment in the infrastructure and culture of the program.','Library science;','Educational evaluation;','Higher Education Administration;','0','3704254'),(427,'Hey, this school library isn\'t what it used to be: The change process and the sociopolitical realities of implementing a curricularly integrated high school information literacy program','DT',2006,'Rojtas-Milliner, Mary Cay','Ed.D.','University of Pittsburgh','','','','','','','','','','','','','United States','University of Pittsburgh','United States','qualitative naturalistic inquiry','case study ','','http://login.ezproxy.library.ualberta.ca/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/305247585?accountid=14474','This study sought to add to the knowledge and understanding of the organizational change process for successfully implementing an integrated information literacy program in one American high school.

The purpose of this study was to describe the perceptions of library media teachers (LMT) and library staff paraprofessionals about the impact of state library funding on library media teachers and library staff paraprofessionals provision of services in school libraries.\r\n\r\nMethodology. The research design used in this study was descriptive ex post facto. Quantitative and qualitative data were collected. Library personnel employed in Fresno County, California, public schools were surveyed to determine the impact of new funding on fifteen variables associated with library service. The survey instrument used a Likert scale to assess impact from minimal to substantial. Responses from library media teachers and paraprofessionals were compared. Open-ended questions were also used to determine presence of facilitators and barriers regarding provision of service.\r\n\r\nFindings and conclusions. A majority of both LMTs and paraprofessionals indicated that the funding substantially impacted their provision of service in the following areas; size of book collection, collection development and planning, budget planning and purchasing guidelines, and resources. Chi-square analysis revealed significant differences between LMTs\' and paraprofessionals\' responses in the following areas: planning, technology, circulation procedures, staff development and training, and teacher collaboration planning. Barriers identified were: funding, lack of adequate support, minimal staffing levels and time constraints. Facilitators identified included; support, funding, and staffing. Five conclusions were drawn from this study: (1) adequate funding enhances services and resource availability for library clients; (2) LMTs are more likely than paraprofessionals to participate in short-term and long-term budget planning; (3) LMTs are more likely than paraprofessionals to ensure technology use, technology purchases, and staff development in technology within the LMC; (4) instructional collaboration between library staff and classroom teachers is enhanced when a LMT works in the library; and (5) the behaviors and actions of site administrators dictate the presence and absence of facilitators and barriers related to the development and improvement of library media programs.\r\n\r\nImplications. Library and site personnel should strive to secure adequate and sustained funding for library media programs. Site administrators should employ LMTs to lead library media programs.

He also addresses the role school librarians could play in successfully implementing the Common Core State Standards (CCSS). Historically being left out of education reforms such as No Child Left Behind in 2001, school media specialists now have the opportunity to shine and show off their unique skill set in curriculum design, information literacy, and research. In collaborating with teachers to carry out lesson plans focused on the CCSS, school librarians can teach students essential skills such as critical thinking, brainstorming, and writing/reading techniques. In discussing why school librarians are needed to complete the success puzzle, the author looks into various course curricula established at Masters of Library Science programs in the United States to trace the development of their skill set, trainings in literacy and research, and the impact these professionals make on a daily basis. The author also shows how school media specialists make a difference in promoting and teaching literacy in inner city schools, which are highly under resourced.

Principals who responded to the study strongly endorsed the role of library media specialist as teacher of information literacy skills and as instructional partner. There was no statistically significant difference in perceptions based on the type of library schedule in place—fixed, flexible, or mixed/combination. Respondents indicated that they learn about the instructional role of the library media specialist from library media specialists with whom they work, either in their current positions as principals or through their previous experiences as classroom teachers. Principals form their views based on both negative and positive interactions with library media specialists and base their expectations of their current and future library media specialists on these prior experiences and expectations.\r\n\r\nThis finding indicates that school library media specialist preparation programs should prepare their graduates to positively present their key instructional role and that training in this area should be provided for those library media specialists already in the field. Another key finding was that principals place primary responsibility for initiation of collaboration at both the individual teacher and the school level with the library media specialist.

The study identifies the requirements of the model and the factors that either promote or undermine the success of the transition.\r\n\r\nA general inductive approach based on qualitative research was used to collect and analyze data obtained from three high school librarians who self-identified as having successfully transitioned a high school library to a learning commons. The two research questions for the study were: (1) What factors determine a successful transition? (2) What factors undermine or threaten the transition? Data was collected through multiple methods including: field notes from site visits, review of participant created websites, as well as interviews conducted in person, by telephone, and by video conference. Coding was used to sort and evaluate data that identified categories and themes that influenced the success of the transition.\r\n\r\nThe transition to a learning commons is analyzed in the context of the tragedy of the commons scenario (Hardin, 1968). The tragedy scenario has its roots in pre-Roman England when farmers grazed their livestock in communally held fields. The growth in demand for the common fields led to increasing herd sizes with no corresponding incentive to maintain the shared resource, leading ultimately to overuse, depletion, herd starvation, and collapse. The tragedy scenario has been applied to analogous issues such as over-fishing, deforestation, and in this study, the highly demanded resources of a modern learning commons.','Library science','Secondary education','','0','3703519'),(438,'Allocating state funds for public school library media programs: A case study of education policymaking in Maryland','DT',2007,'Bailey, Gail Margaret','Ed.D.','University of Maryland, College Park','','','','','','','','','','','','','United States','University of Maryland, College Park','United States','case study','','','http://login.ezproxy.library.ualberta.ca/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/250029887?accountid=14474','The research had three purposes: to determine what factors account for the legislative decision outcomes resulting in the allocation of state funds for Maryland\'s school library media programs in 1998 and the denial of continued funding in 2001; to test the capacity of an integrated policymaking model to account for legislative victory and defeat; and to add to literature on state education policymaking in Maryland and school library media funding decisions in state arenas.\r\n\r\nThe study employed an integrated framework developed by combining Kingdon\'s (1995) multiple streams model with Mazzoni\'s (1993) power and influence model to examine each legislative decision making event as a political process influenced by the power of the players and shaped by developments in each of the multiple streams. In combination, these two frameworks helped to analyze how efforts to secure dedicated state funding for school library media programs succeeded in 1998 and failed in 2001. The investigator employed an exploratory case study to render a provisional interpretation of the two legislative decision outcomes regarding state funds for school library media programs.\r\n\r\nThe case study produced findings that point to two significant factors that impacted the ability of advocates to secure categorical state funding for school library media programs in 1998 but not in 2001: (1) the key role played or not played by the governor and (2) contextual forces that either enabled or constrained advocacy efforts.\r\n\r\nThe study demonstrates the utility of the integrated model in explaining state education policymaking. Kingdon\'s multiple streams concept provides broad analytic categories as manageable units of analysis and Mazzoni\'s power and influence categories provide the analytic tools required to map out the dynamics in each stream.

Results indicate a substantial discrepancy in library staffing levels from the elementary grades through the high schools. Nevertheless, statistically significant correlations were found between certificated staffing levels and student achievement at each grade. Significant correlations persisted at the elementary and middle school when controlling for five of six school and community variables, and at the high school when controlling for all six of those variables. Bivariate correlations between total staffing and student achievement were significant at both the middle school and high school level when controlling for all school and community variables. Generally, the strength of the correlations between both certificated and total staffing tended to increase with grade level; at the high school level, correlations were among the strongest reported in any statewide study to date.\r\n\r\nThere was a significant positive relationship between a majority of the 21 library services regularly provided and student achievement at all levels. Total library services were significantly related to student achievement at all levels when controlling for all school and community variables. In multiple regression analyses, there was an increasingly stronger relationship between total library programs and student achievement by grade level when controlling for all school and community variables. At every level, certificated and total staffing levels were associated with the strength of library program elements.\r\n\r\nThe findings from this study confirm a host of prior research on the relationship between school libraries and student achievement and point to inequitable access to school library services in California. Results from this study might also provide a baseline of data for qualitative research that more deeply explores ways school library programs contribute to student achievement beyond ways measured by current standardized tests.','Library science','Elementary education','Secondary education','0','3376017'),(440,'Demonstration Investigation of Modernization Management of Inland Elementary and Middle School Library','DT',2006,'Zhao, Wei Kai','M.A.','Hebei University','','','','','','','','','','','','','China','Hebei University','China','Investigation ','comparison ','deductive method','http://search.proquest.com/docview/1026711880?accountid=14474','This article is based on the theory of management science, library management science and education science.

This phenomenological study examined interactions, experiences, impressions, and involvement levels of practicing SLMSs regarding professional library/media associations in order to identify and present the essence of their experiences with the association phenomenon. In-depth interviews from a purposefully selected sample of 14 SLMSs, a focus group of attendees at a state library association conference, and responses to two online surveys supplied participant data to address two central questions: (a) how do School Library Media Specialists, with knowledge of the same state or national professional library/media association/s, perceive those association experiences in their professional and personal lives? (b) what situations and relationships impacted or influenced their experiences?\r\n\r\nAnalytical steps from the phenomenological qualitative approach were utilized with the data to reveal eight themes about association experiences of participating SLMSs. Associations: (a) have multifaceted components; (b) are often introduced by mentors; (c) can help SLMSs deal with professional and emotional reactions to their work; (d) offer and promote linking with peers; (e) exist only through member activity, but knowledge about and membership do not require activity; (f) assist all librarians with professional advocacy; (g) design annual and/or bi-annual conferences as informative fellowship events; and, (h) may have leaders who can be highly invested in the organization. Further findings indicate SLMSs\' perceptions of experiences with professional library associations are influenced by three major themes: (1) their own Internal Composition, (2), impact of External Forces on their life, and (3) the influence of the Omnipresent Association, all of which interplay with peer connections, association leadership, and advocacy directives for the field. The study revealed interpersonal connections to professional associations may fluctuate, and the enticement of involvement is often dependent upon peer connections. Implications are that associations should strive for a multifaceted structure with abundant human connectivity options in order to be viable, progressive, and foster leadership training. SLMSs may consider actively supporting association agendas promoting mentorship, diversity recruitment, leadership, and advocacy for the field.','Library science','Education','Organizational behavior','0','3399275'),(442,'Organizational culture of an academic library','DT',2000,'Lee, Soyeon','Ph.D.','The University of Texas at Austin','','','','','','','','','','','','','United States','The University of Texas at Austin','United States','interviews ','field observation','survey ','http://login.ezproxy.library.ualberta.ca/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/304620772?accountid=14474','The purpose of this study is to explore the culture of an academic library, fictitiously titled the New Millennium Library (NML).

The hiring administrators also added several attributes to the original list, including managing multiple priorities, being learning/student oriented (especially toward low achievers), being self-directed with a good work ethic, being able to relate effectively to all constituencies, and experience in the same type of institution for which the administrator would be hiring the ALD.','Library science','Higher education','School administration','0','3188014'),(445,'A mixed -methods approach to the identification and measurement of academic library service quality constructs: LibQUAL+™','DT',2001,'Cook, Carol Colleen','Ph.D.','Texas A&M University,','','','','','','','','','','','','','United States','Texas A&M University','United States','Interviews ','survey ','','http://login.ezproxy.library.ualberta.ca/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/304768219?accountid=14474','The purpose of the study was threefold: first, to fill a knowledge void in modeling the dimensions of library service quality from the user perspective; second, based upon the model, to develop a web-delivered, effective total market survey for service quality assessment in academic libraries; and third, using the derived instrument, to recommend a process for an ongoing program of comparative outcome measurement for academic libraries.\r\n\r\nInterviews with academic library users affirmed the presence of SERVQUAL dimensions of Assurance, Responsiveness, Empathy, Reliability and Tangibles in the service quality construct for academic libraries, and surfaced additional theoretical dimensions specific to libraries: Collections, Ubiquity of Access, Library as Place, and Self-reliance. A model of service quality supporting this construct was tested through a 56-question, web-based survey instrument, administered to 20,416 users of 43 academic libraries in spring 2001. Analysis largely affirmed the theoretical model of service quality with some modifications: Affect of Service subsumed the affective elements of SERVQUAL dimensions; Library as Place was supported as an expansion of SERVQUAL Tangibles; a proposed dimension of Self-reliance was subsumed in a dimension of Personal Control and a fourth dimension of Information Access subsumed Collections.\r\n\r\nFrom validity and reliability analyses of the 56-question pilot instrument, a parsimonious 25-question tool, LibQUAL+™, was proposed to serve as a total market survey for academic libraries.

The study took place over a 4-month period between February and May 2006.\r\n\r\nThe review of literature included a brief history of the development of consortia, problems inherent with the implementation of ERPs, and best practices to ensure a successful ERP implementation. Phase I of the data collection involved a brief telephone call with the local site coordinators of 57 MOBIUS member institutions to determine the level of ERP adoption at each institution based on Rogers\' (2003) diffusion model. Statistical outliers, high and low adopters, were identified using these data. Phase I examined whether there was a relationship between institutional adoption and a set of independent variables: funding orientation (public vs. private), size of institution, and location of institution (urban vs. rural). The researcher\'s interpretation and analysis of Phase I data indicated that while funding orientation and location were not significant, the size of the institution\'s full-time equivalent enrollment was a significant factor in predicting the level of adoption a participating institution was likely to achieve.\r\n\r\nPhase II of the study involved in-person, audiotaped interviews with directors of nine MOBIUS member libraries.

By tracking the construction of school library resources and programs at a secondary school where no library existed, I was able to explore the processes and elements of library formation as it impacts the literacy environment. My hunch was that by improving the available resources in a distributed library, the opportunities for access and choice, and by developing the library dispositions of the students there might be observable changes in students\' reading attitudes, engagement and achievement at the school. These library dispositions include developing habits of mind and attitudes that guide student thinking and intellectual behaviors, and that may be measured through actions taken to access library resources and to read independently.\r\n\r\nIn this study I viewed the school library project as an intervention—one that sought to develop a culture of reading and information use with adolescents—by attending to access, choice, motivation and engagement in reading, and by collaborating with amenable content area teachers on instructional supports. My initial research concerns included how library dispositions are taken up in a school, or not, as a distributed library was developed on site; what barriers and benefits of building library resources and instructional connections to students and content area curricula might be evident; and how increased access to resources might impact the attitudes about reading and reading achievement of a focal group of students. The design research approach allows an examination of the impact of the library as intervention (the product) as it is engineered and adapted with input from the school community (the process).\r\n\r\nThis dissertation argues that the school library exists in an academic Third Space animated by constant tensions: in the ideological space between traditional in-school instructional goals and out-of-school learning priorities, in the curricular space between explicit curricular requirements and independent learning desires, and in the physical space between facility competitions for access to group learning space versus individual learning space.','Library science','Secondary education','','0','3498970'),(450,'Perceptions of school library media specialists regarding their roles and practices','DT',2000,'McCracken, Anne','Ph.D.','George Mason University','','','','','','','','','','','','','United States','George Mason University','United States','survey','','','http://login.ezproxy.library.ualberta.ca/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/304671990?accountid=14474','This study examines the views of school library media specialists in regards to their roles and functions in comparison with the standards published by professional associations.

Therefore this study seeks to determine if practicing school librarians have been able to implement the 1988 and 1998 national standards and if they think it is important to implement the standards at their school. This study also attempts to determine if there is a correlation between descriptive variables (level of school. i.e. elementary or secondary, the number of years of professional experience as a school library media specialist, the number of years experience as a classroom teacher, the amount of available technology, the presence of an automated circulation and cataloging system, and the type of scheduling that the librarian uses, flexible, fixed, or a combination), and the reported practices and views of school library media specialists. A historical review of the literature revealed that school librarians have been asked to assume a wide variety of roles and that there has been confusion in the profession regarding the role of the school librarian. To determine what the perceptions of school librarians are regarding their roles and practices the researcher has developed a survey. The survey is comprised of statements regarding the roles of the school library media specialist as described in the 1988 and 1998 editions of Information Power. For each statement respondents are asked to answer the following questions, “Do you practice this?” and “Do you think this is an important part of the school library media specialist\'s role?” The survey will be mailed to a random sampling of 1,000 K–12 school library media specialists in the United States.

There were significant differences in school library media program areas of expenditures, collection size, software, computers and resources between middle schools with district media personnel and middle schools without such a position. The perceptions of leadership and support provided by district media personnel was rated as outstanding in three of the four school library media program areas.','Library science','School administration','','0','3345643'),(453,'A case study of four school library media specialists\' leadership in Louisiana','DT',2003,'Underwood, Linda Jean','','West Virginia University','','','','','','','','','','','','','United States','West Virginia University','United States','interviews','observation field notes','written documentation from the three schools','http://login.ezproxy.library.ualberta.ca/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/305279058?accountid=14474','The purpose of this study was to understand the daily activities of effective school library media specialists in an elementary school, middle school, and high school in a Louisiana parish, non-church, public school system through qualitative research using interviews, observation field notes, and written documentation from the three schools. The importance of the study was that there is little known about the leadership role of the school library media specialist and the role of the school library media specialist. Further, the literature concerning effective schools and effective school library media specialists is separate. The study had four conclusions. First, an effective school library media specialist can be the hub of the school. Second, the effective school library media specialist can lead from the middle through technology expertise, collaborative planning, promoting reading and positive public relations. Next, the effective school library media specialist is supported by the positive perceptions of the superintendent, school principal, library supervisor, and classroom teachers who all realize the importance of the school library media program to academic achievement. Even though the programs do not completely meet the standards, through the leadership that evolved from daily collaboration, the school library media specialists in this study managed to provide effective programs. Last, the school library media specialists are enabled by the positive perceptions of the superintendent, scheduling and financial support from the school principal, the advocacy of the library supervisor, and the use of the center by teachers. However, constraints such as a lack of time for collaborative planning, lack of paraprofessional staff, inadequate funding and no substitutes for the school library media specialists constrain them.','Library science','Curricula','Teaching','0','3132971'),(454,'Social capital experiences of solo middle school librarians at a public school district in south Texas: A phenomenological study','DT',2016,'Lilly, Jessica Michelle','Ed.D.','Sam Houston State University','','','','','','','','','','','','','United States','Sam Houston State University','United States','qualitative ','phenomenological','semi-structured interviews','http://login.ezproxy.library.ualberta.ca/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1861174470?accountid=14474','Purpose\r\n\r\nThe results of a pilot study (Lilly Hughes, 2013) I completed in 2013 sparked my interest in investigating the social capital activities of the solo middle school librarian. I investigated a sample of middle school solo librarians in a large Texas school district as they shared their participation and experiences with librarian-to-librarian social capital. First, the social capital activities in which solo middle school librarians and other librarians participate were identified. Second, the social capital activities in which solo middle school librarians participate with other solo librarians within their school district were identified. Third, the factors that influenced the solo middle school librarian’s ability to participate in social capital activities were examined.\r\n\r\nMethod\r\n\r\nA qualitative approach was used to determine solo middle school librarians’ opinions about social capital experiences at a public school district in south Texas. A phenomenological approach was used because this study involves real-life, contemporary settings. Five solo middle school librarians were interviewed in this study. Recorded, semi-structured interviews were conducted with the solo middle school librarians at each school or home allowing the participants to describe their feelings about and perceptions of these experiences. Using the participants’ responses in the interviews, I interpreted the data to understand the phenomenon.\r\n\r\nResults\r\n\r\nA high degree of consensus across the 5 solo middle school librarians led to the themes of collegiality, professional organizations, principal support, librarians are teachers, and isolation. Implications for practice included librarian advocacy for principal support of additional support staff. Findings relevant for policy included the need for updated state library standards. The need for increased library staffing and opportunities for solo middle school librarian to experience social capital opportunities was confirmed. Not all participants in this study value all social capital experiences. The same was discovered true for each participant regarding the benefit of social capital experiences provided by professional organizations and social media on their professional practice. All participants agreed some form of self-imposed restrictions have been made regarding involvement in social capital experiences because each is alone on the job, which restricts their time and stamina to engage with other school librarians.','Library science','School administration','','0','10306223'),(455,'Joint use library standards for Texas school/public libraries: A Delphi study','DT',2016,'Casstevens, Susan Waller','Ed.D.','Dallas Baptist University','','','','','','','','','','','','','United States','Dallas Baptist University','United States','survey','','','http://login.ezproxy.library.ualberta.ca/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1785373302?accountid=14474','Twenty-four joint use school/public libraries serve K-12 students and public communities in Texas.

In the current study, the researcher utilized a Delphi study to develop library standards for shared school/public libraries in Texas. Texas Public Library Standards (Texas Library Association, 2014), School Library Programs: Standards and Guidelines for Texas (Texas State Library and Archives Commission, 2005), and the Minimum Requirements for Accreditation in the Texas State Library System (Texas Administrative Code, 2015) were correlated to create proposed joint use library standards. A Delphi panel of 29 library experts participated in the current study. The library expert panel included national and international library leaders and authors from school, academic, public, and joint use libraries. University researchers, including several Texas State Library librarians and Texas Library Association librarians, also served on the Delphi panel. During three rounds of surveys the library experts identified categories and components for developing effective Joint Use Library Standards. At the conclusion of the study, consensus was achieved for 42 library standards. The Delphi method identified objectives, goals, and principles that the library experts agreed should be included in Texas Joint Use Library Standards. From the 42 joint use library standards, a checklist was developed for school/public libraries to assess effective library service.','Library science','School administration','Education','0','10101026'),(456,'Perspectives of school administrators related to school library media programs after participating in an online course, “School Library Advocacy for Administrators”','DT',2009,'Levitov, Deborah Detenbeck','','','','','','','','','','','','','','','United States','University of Missouri - Columbia','United States','surveys','action plans','feedback sheets and demographic information','http://login.ezproxy.library.ualberta.ca/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/868575251?accountid=14474','This mixed methods study examines the experiences of two groups of administrators who participated in the online course, \"School Library Advocacy for Administrators,\" respectively, in the summer of 2005 and the fall of 2006. The course was offered through Mansfield University in Mansfield, Pennsylvania. It was developed to educate administrators about school library media programs and the role of the library media specialist, and to subsequently create administrative advocates for school libraries. The purpose of this study is to explore how these administrators perceive that the course made a difference in what they know about school library media programs and how the information impacted their perspectives and actions in relationship to the library media programs in their buildings.\r\n\r\nEmploying a mixed methods approach, this study makes use of standardized responses from surveys, action plans, feedback sheets and demographic information. In addition, it uses descriptive/phenomenological methods to examine the lived experiences of the participants through interviews. Participants’ perceptions, shared through semi-structured interviews, are the result of their individual interpretations of the meanings assigned to events and to acquired knowledge. The interviews show how participants make meaning of their experiences related to a Mansfield University online course and how they put the resulting action plans to work.\r\n\r\nFindings indicate that the Mansfield University online course provides an impetus for participating administrators to change their perceptions toward library media programs and make changes in their school library programs to some degree. Based on these findings, the Mansfield online course appears to offer a viable solution for informing educational administrators about school library programs.

In spite of these findings, many school libraries today are undervalued and underutilized, often becoming the first victim of budget cuts. In Texas, as well as other states, the current debate over what should be considered a direct classroom instructional expense threatens the very existence of school libraries and librarians. If libraries are classified as educational support, many districts will no longer be able to afford library materials or certified librarians. This study reviews research citing the lack of support for school libraries, both philosophically and financially, from school principals. The author reports on the findings of a survey conducted to determine if school administrators believe that an effective school library program can increase student achievement. The author suggests that (a) further research into the beliefs of school administrators regarding the instructional role of the school library is necessary in order to facilitate full integration of school libraries into the instructional program through administrator/librarian collaboration, and (b) school librarians should conduct action research to identify the specific aspects of the school library program that contribute to academic achievement.','Library science','School administration','Curricula','0','3258360'),(458,'School library selection policy and procedures: A survey of attitudes, perceptions and experiences of Texas public-school principals and certified librarians','DT',2006,'Shupala, Andrew Michael','Ed.D.','Texas A&M University - Corpus Christi','','','','','','','','','','','','','United States','Texas A&M University - Corpus Christi','United States','qualitative ','quantitative ','survey','http://login.ezproxy.library.ualberta.ca/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/304910929?accountid=14474','The purpose of this study was to survey Texas public-school principals and certified librarians\' attitudes, perceptions and experiences with regard to school library policy for media selection and procedures for responding to complaints against library media. Analysis of the data involved a methodology of the mixed-methods explanatory design, in which the purpose of the qualitative phase was to possibly explain or provide understanding of the results in the quantitative phase. For the qualitative phase, the study involved content analysis of the survey\'s two open-ended survey questions. In the quantitative phase, the study used the causal-comparative design to address the research questions and hypotheses. Analysis of the survey data included chi-square analysis, independent samples t-test, and multiple linear regression analysis. Selection of the principals and certified librarians was proportionate and stratified according to the state\'s 20 Education Service Center regions. Of the 1,036 Independent School Districts that employed the state population of 10,014 principals and certified librarians, 275 Independent School Districts (26.5 percent) allowed participation in the survey. Of the state population of principals and certified librarians, the 275 school districts accounted for 988 of the 3,382 certified librarians (29.2 percent) and 1,941 of the 6,632 principals (29.3 percent). Both personnel groups were represented in each of the 20 Education Service Center regions. The survey response rate for the principals was 20.0 percent while the response rate for the certified librarians was 34.7 percent. The results were not generalized to the state population of principals and certified librarians because random sampling of the state population had not been possible. However, the demographic and employment characteristics of the response sample were comparable to those of the state population. Quantitative findings indicated the need for further research with regard to whether or not library media complaint procedures were duly followed during previous school years and whether or not conflict had occurred between the principals and the certified librarians as they implemented complaint procedures. The quantitative findings also indicated the need for further research with regard to library media complaints as reported by the two personnel groups and according to district enrollment size, county population size, and the three education levels. The study\'s qualitative findings supported the quantitative findings. Moreover, the study\'s qualitative findings indicated as well, that the principals and certified librarians\' appreciation of selection policy and complaint procedures occasionally differed because of the principals\' different legal perspective of library selection policy and complaint procedures. The qualitative findings suggested that the research emphasis for school censorship and school library policy and procedures should include consideration of legal due process, in addition to consideration of student First Amendment rights. Because of the principals\' different legal perspective, the qualitative findings also suggested the need for further predictive analyses using the differing legal opinions as predictors of the principals and certified librarians\' opinions of school library policy and complaint procedures.

However, some school librarians have been unable to implement this model. This begs the question, why are some librarians able to establish such programs while others fail? There is research literature in education that acknowledges the importance of school culture as a factor in instructional innovations. Yet this is not an issue that has been addressed to a great extent within the Library and Information Science (LIS) literature regarding school library programs. Examining the culture in schools with effective school library programs may help to identify factors that support implementing the Information Power model. This dissertation describes a multiple case study of four K-12 schools. Each of the schools has received a national award recognizing the effectiveness of the library based on criteria established by the American Association of School Librarians (AASL). Giddens\' structuration theory (1984), Senge\'s (1990) concepts of the learning organization, and Schein\'s (1992) theory of organizational culture provide the framework for this dissertation. The approach to analysis is consistent with the tenets of naturalistic research and reflects the assumptions of a qualitative research more generally. Common patterns found at each site include the presence of a collaborative culture, the collaborative leadership style of the principal, and high expectations for the students and staff. LIS professors may use these conclusions in the instruction of school library candidates. School librarians may use this data in aligning their programs with national standards. Future research includes replicating this study using a larger number of schools to determine if the same patterns will surface. Additional research needs to be conducted analyzing the role of culture in organizations, the influence of interactions among the major players in the schools, and the change process.','Library science','Elementary education','Secondary education','0','3347462'),(460,'Responses of listener-viewers in digital storytelling: Collaborations in the intermediate classroom and the middle school library','DT',2011,'Morris, Rebecca J.','Ph.D.','University of Pittsburgh','','','','','','','','','','','','','United States','University of Pittsburgh','United States','observation ','','','http://login.ezproxy.library.ualberta.ca/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/908423953?accountid=14474','Storytelling in its traditional form, with active participation by tellers and listeners, is a valuable model for contemporary library and classroom experiences. Digital storytelling expands opportunities for storytelling in libraries, and reflects a continuity of innovative library services for children and students. For this study, “digital storytelling” is defined as a short, multimedia presentation of a story, created by students, under the guidance of school librarians or teachers. Because much of the literature and practice of digital storytelling emphasizes the creator, or teller, this research examines the response of the “listener-viewers” to explore and support in a digital environment the interactions afforded to audiences of traditional, live storytelling. This research study is a mixed methods investigation centered upon participant-observation of digital storytelling in intermediate classroom and middle school library settings. The research findings show six prominent themes representing how students respond to and engage in digital storytelling, presented in the study in a conceptual model. The themes are Engagement, Action, Emotions, Learning, Similar Experiences, and Next Steps. Key components of digital storytelling as a classroom and school library activity are the “self” as a viewer of digital storytelling, formative and summative viewing practices, and how classroom teachers and school librarians teach and facilitate digital storytelling, including integration of technology and information literacies and collaboration.','Library science','Middle School education','Educational technology','0','3485760'),(461,'Library culture, library climate, and library productivity: An exploratory study','DT',1990,'Chapman, Marion Evans','Ed.D.','Peabody College for Teachers of Vanderbilt University','','','','','','','','','','','','','United States','Peabody College for Teachers of Vanderbilt University','United States','interview ','','','http://login.ezproxy.library.ualberta.ca/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/303845084?accountid=14474','This exploratory study was undertaken to identify the constructs of library culture, library climate, and library productivity and to develop instruments to measure these constructs. The study was conducted in three separate phases: (a) Definition and construct identification phase, (b) Instrument development and refinement phase, and (c) Field test phase. Six constructs of library culture, library climate, and library productivity were identified. I was given assistance from 15 school library media specialists in identifying these constructs. Once the constructs were identified, three inventories and three interview protocols were developed to measure the constructs. The instruments were field tested in nine schools in Tennessee--three elementary, three middle, and three high schools. The inventories were administered to the teachers and other professional staff, except the media specialist and the principal. These individuals as well as students were interviewed.\r\n\r\nThe data analyzed and findings were presented for each phase of the study. Because this was an exploratory study, further testing of the instruments was recommended. Overall, the elementary schools in the sample received the highest mean scores. The interview findings were highly correlated to the findings of the inventories, because the principals, students, and library media specialists who were interviewed, generally, made more positive remarks concerning the culture, climate, and productivity of elementary school library media centers.\r\n\r\nThe new guidelines for school library media centers challenge the profession to look for new ways of evaluating school library media centers which would provide qualitative as well as quantitative data. The inventories and interview protocols developed for this study provide both types of data.

The variable for the Accountability Index was from the 2005-06 school year. School library media specialists across the state of Kentucky were asked to participate in a survey at www.surveymonkey.com. Out of the 1207 public requests there were 126 responses used in the data analysis. The instrument used in this study was created by combining questions from two previous studies.

A pilot study investigated a convenience sample of 25 secondary school library media specialists. The results of the pilot study were incorporated in the main study which utilized two instruments. The first instrument was a survey, Role Expectations of Library Media Specialists Survey, which was administered to 124 library media specialists. The subjects were invited, in the opening session of a conference, to be the convenience sample. The second research instrument was the Information Power Interview, a one-on-one interview with a designed protocol. This interview was conducted in one school district with 25 library media specialists, each independent of the others in a school environment. They were also a convenience sample.\r\n\r\nThe first instrument used a Likert Scale to rate forty-six items related to library media specialists\' role performance. The five items most directly related to the research questions served as the focus of analysis. The second instrument, the Information Power Interview, used 10 open-ended questions. Emphasis in both instruments was on the role perceptions of the library media specialist. This mixed design study used frequencies that produced data files yielding tabulations and percentages from the pilot study research, the research survey data and data from the interviews which contained open-ended questions. Demographic questions were also asked of each interviewee. Comments from the pilot study questionnaire, as well as the interview profiles, were used to support the data.\r\n\r\nThese findings indicate that library media specialists perceive their roles as prescribed by the American Library Association as being essential to impact the Information era demands. The study showed that library media specialists not only perceive the roles set forth by the American Library Association, but are relating those perceptions to plans of performance in the changing roles. Several recommendations are offered for further research to more fully describe the current roles of library media specialists.','Library science',' Curricula','Teaching','0','3051365'),(469,'Academic library directors\' perceptions of joining a large library consortium sharing an integrated library system: A descriptive survey','DT',2011,'Krieb, Dennis E.','Ed.D.','The University of Nebraska - Lincoln','','','','','','','','','','','','','United States','The University of Nebraska - Lincoln','United States','survey ','','','http://login.ezproxy.library.ualberta.ca/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/861326175?accountid=14474','The collective holdings of CARLI\' s (Consortium of Academic and Research Libraries in Illinois) “I-Share” catalog total approximately 32 million items. It is the third largest academic catalog in the United States, however only 76 of CARLI\' s 148 academic libraries participate in I-Share. This descriptive survey examined the factors that influenced a CARLI academic library director\' s decision to join, or not join, I-Share\' s integrated library system. Seventy-seven of the 145 CARLI library directors sampled completed the web-based survey. This represented a 53.1% response rate.\r\n\r\nThe framework for the survey was designed around three sections; advantages, disadvantages, and obstacles to participating in I-Share. Directors were asked to select the level of importance of I-Share benefits, and their level of agreement to questions regarding the disadvantages and obstacles to participating in I-Share. These questions were based on a Likert scale and assigned numeric values. An independent samples t-test compared I-Share and non I-Share directors\' responses by institution type and collectively. The difference in 11 of 12 comparisons was found to be statistically significant.\r\n\r\nThrough five open-ended questions, several themes were discovered. Benefits associated with resource sharing were consistently stated as being the most influential factor for I-Share member directors to participate in I-Share. Other important benefits mentioned were I-Share\' s value, centralized technical support, and the opportunity to collaborate closely with other libraries.\r\n\r\nWith non I-Share library directors, reasons not to join I-Share differed with institution types. For some community college library directors, the decision to remain with a local, multi-type library system was based upon the needs of their student populations. Among the reasons given by non I-Share library directors from independent—not for profit institutions was the preference to manage an integrated library system “in-house”. The infrequency of I-Share open enrollment periods, and migration costs associated with unbundling records from a current ILS, were viewed by all survey respondents as being the most serious obstacles to I-Share participation.','Community college education','Library science','Higher education','0','3445417'),(470,'Leadership through middle school library programming: Impact on Latino student achievement','DT',2009,'Nelson, Jeanne Vivian','Ed.D.','University of California, San Diego','','','','','','','','','','','','','United States','University of California, San Diego','United States','Survey ','','','http://login.ezproxy.library.ualberta.ca/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/304852062?accountid=14474','The No Child Left Behind (NCLB) emphasis on high-stakes testing and accountability mandates that all students achieve at a proficient level on standardized tests or their school/district will face sanctions. Disaggregation of data by ethnicity has determined an achievement gap between groups of students, a gap that is not lessening as all students increase in academic achievement. In response, educators have implemented various intervention programs. Services and programming available through the school library are noticeably absent from these intervention programs, even though a number of large-scale studies indicate that library services have a positive and significant impact on student achievement. This mixed-methods study proposed a new theoretical model for viewing the school library. Staffing, access, resources and services provided through middle school libraries in California, were compared with academic outcomes for white and Latino student populations. Data from the California Assessment Test, Sixth Edition (CAT/6) and the California State Library Survey were compiled and compared with interviews of certificated middle school teacher librarians. The study determined that there was a significant positive relationship between the level of professional library staffing and student CAT/6 reading outcomes. The data also indicate that at higher performing schools, a higher percentage of library services and resources are provided for both Latino and white students. Implications for library leadership, policy and practice are discussed, with suggestions for different models of information literacy instruction.','Bilingual education','Library science','Curriculum development','0','3349790'),(471,'Student perceptions and expectations of library services quality and user satisfaction at Walters State Community College','DT',2009,'Posey, James A.','Ed.D.','East Tennessee State University','','','','','','','','','','','','','United States','East Tennessee State University','United States','Independent samples t tests','','','http://login.ezproxy.library.ualberta.ca/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/304885606?accountid=14474','The purpose of this study was to explore students’ perceptions of library services offered at Walters State Community College. This research involved LibQUAL+™, a nationally known academic library assessment instrument that measures three dimensions on a scale of approximately 22 aspects of service, divided into 6 groups (Heath, Kyrillidou, & Askew, 2004, p.264). These 3 dimensions are the following: Affect of Service (AS), Information Control (IC), and Library as a Place (LP). Responses of 666 students at Walters State Community College, Morristown, Tennessee, indicated the students’ perceptions of acceptable minimum level of service, perceived levels of service, and desired levels of service. Each dimension was assessed by mean scores and p values to determine students’ level of satisfaction with the library.\r\n\r\nIndependent samples t tests were conducted to analyze the association between perceived means of the 3 service quality dimensions for the following: (1) Walters State Community College compared to 4 other community colleges, (2) male and female students at Walters State Community College, (3) traditional students 22 years old and younger and nontraditional students over age 22 at Walters State Community College. Pearson’s correlation was conducted to analyze the relationship between library budgets and library services.\r\n\r\nBased on the findings of this study, Walters State Community College Library’s mean scores were higher than the other 4 community college’s in the 3 service quality dimensions. However, Walters State Community College’s results indicated substantial room for improvement in the Affect of Service dimension. The mean scores between male and female students at Walters State College showed no differences among the 3 service quality dimensions. The findings also indicated that nontraditional students over age 22 rated Affect of Service and Information Control higher than did traditional students age 22 and younger. In addition, findings indicated a fairly strong relationship between library budget and the Information Control dimension for the 5 community colleges studied.\r\n\r\nThe data offered in this study provided useful information for library self-study and ideas for improving the college’s library services.','Community college education','Library science','School administration','0','3361650'),(472,'An examination of diversity within three Southeastern academic libraries: A mixed-methods, multi-site study','DT',2014,'Shaffer, Christopher A.','Ed.D.','Alabama State University','','','','','','','','','','','','','United States','Alabama State University','United States','interviews','survey ','','http://login.ezproxy.library.ualberta.ca/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1557817157?accountid=14474','The purpose of this study was to determine the extent to which three academic libraries in the Southeastern United States could be considered diverse. This was a multi-site, mixed methods study. It examined the climate and culture of the libraries, which was assessed through two methods; the first, through survey responses from full-time faculty and staff members at the three libraries studied. Secondly, selected individuals, including the deans of all three libraries, participated in interviews with the researcher, to shed further light on the climate and culture of the libraries. A raw catalog count of each library’s monographic collection was conducted, using diversity-themed keyword searches. Recent programming, when relevant was also considered as a method of concretely measuring diversity.\r\n\r\nResults of the study indicated that librarians at all three institutions valued the concept of diversity within their libraries, particularly in terms of their collections. However, under further scrutiny, particularly concerning issues such as homosexuality and speaking foreign languages in the workplace, survey responses indicated some reluctance by faculty and staff to fully embrace all areas of diversity. Librarians interviewed consistently indicated they viewed libraries as safe harbors that contain a wide array of diverse materials. All indicated there were materials within their libraries that contradicted their personal belief system and believed that was acceptable, because libraries exist for people of all beliefs.\r\n\r\nAs a result of this study, several recommendations emerged for both library administrators and policy makers as well as library science researchers. A primary policy recommendation is for academic libraries to be well-funded. A diverse library is impossible to create and maintain without proper funding. Diversity policies need to be created to reinforce the concept that diversity is a key component of the library. Diversity should be institutionally promoted through public programming grants and encouraging librarians to apply for fellowships and other programs that expose them to diverse concepts.\r\n\r\nFuture research on this topic would prove to be enlightening. Research outside of the Southeast region would allow for an assessment of whether information gleaned in this study is consistent on a national level in the United States. Electronic databases are a major component of an academic libraries’ collection and could be examined as one more component of diversity.','Educational sociology','Library science','Education Policy','0','3583107'),(473,'Perceptions and stages of concern of selected high school library media specialists about GALILEO, a statewide virtual library','DT',2002,'Buddy, Juanita Warren','Ph.D.','Georgia State University','','','','','','','','','','','','','United States','Georgia State University','United States','Interviews','','','http://login.ezproxy.library.ualberta.ca/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/305529670?accountid=14474','The study was an investigation of the perceptions and stages of concerns of selected high school library media specialists regarding the use of GeorgiA LIbrary LEarning Online, GALILEO. The Concerns-Based Adoption Model (CBAM) (Hall, Wallace, & Dossett, 1973) and the Diffusion of Innovation Model (Rogers, 1995) provided the theoretical framework for the study.\r\n\r\nInterviews with administrators associated with GALILEO and a questionnaire comprised the methodology of the study. The questionnaire included (a) attributes of an innovation (Rogers, 1995) and voluntariness (Moore & Benbasat, 1991), (b) Stages of Concern Questionnaire (SoCQ from CBAM, (c) communication channels for information about GALILEO, (d) strategies for informing the school community about GALILEO, and (e) demographic information.

Of this total student population, 25.2 percent consists of English Language Learners (ELLs)—predominantly Spanish-speaking students (DSISD, 2011). Current DSISD library collection figures reveal that each campus library has an inordinate low number of Spanish materials. The district librarians are guided by an acquisitions policy that seemingly offers scant guidelines for acquiring books that address the information and literary needs of diverse student populations.\r\n\r\nTo this end, it is vital to examine and bring better understanding of how school librarians make decisions when ordering library materials that may impact the delivery of library services to Spanish-speaking ELLs. This study considers how school library acquisition policy may possibly affect the delivery of library services to middle school Spanish-speaking English Language Learners.\r\n\r\nUtilizing a qualitative design and relying heavily on interviews in multiple settings, the study shows how school librarians make sense of the school district acquisitions policy and how they justify their acquisitions decisions. Moreover, the study also presents the middle school ELLs\' experience in their respective libraries, how they perceive the delivery of library services, and how they make meaning and sense of their respective library Spanish collections.\r\n\r\nThe analysis of the study revealed that the ELLs\' feelings and opinions about the importance of their respective library Spanish collections varied between campuses. Their sentiments concerning the library Spanish collections had much to do with the degree to which they value their home language. The manner in which the ELLs perceive the delivery of library services was more explicit. Overwhelmingly, they are quite appreciative of their respective librarians and purport the services as being caring, useful, and helpful at all three campuses. The study also revealed that the school librarians\' interpretation of the policy does not allow for developing the Spanish collection because acting as \"street-level bureaucrats\" (Lipsky, 2010), they make broad discretionary decisions about acquiring library books to appease teacher requests at the expense of Spanish-speaking library patrons. Moreover, acting as \"street-level bureaucrat,\" they want to serve individuals, but end up serving collectively due to teacher requests. Ostensibly, the manner in which the librarians interpret the district acquisitions policy has an impact on the delivery of service provided by the librarians. Providing fair and equitable library service would be an effective means to assure impartial availability of services and equitable access to library materials, particularly in campuses with significant ELL populations.\r\n\r\nMore emphasis should be placed on how librarians serve their community of patrons and how they engender a feeling of trust, welcomeness, and acceptance. As responsible and conscientious librarians they are obligated to uphold the philosophy of intellectual freedom as it concerns a person\'s access to all library materials. There should be a certain degree of diligence in making sure that the diversity of library collections not be limited and in this manner inclusiveness and not exclusiveness should be the standard in collection development. Recommendations for these serious issues are directed in the conclusion of this paper.','Library science','English as a Second Language','Educational leadership','0','3568481'),(475,'The transition of the Ivy Tech State College library system from traditional to electronic','DT',2001,'McKiel, Allen William','Ph.D.','Indiana State University','','','','','','','','','','','','','United States','Indiana State University','United States','case study','','','http://login.ezproxy.library.ualberta.ca/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/251801227?accountid=14474','The potential of the electronic dissemination of information to eclipse publication through print technology threatens the existence of academic libraries to the degree that the management of physical resources circumscribes their existence.

Five general findings emerged from the reports of their experiences with electronic resources. First, the librarians described the library operations that have persisted in the context of electronic resources. The librarians depicted electronic counterparts for the acquisition, circulation, reference, instruction, organization, and cataloging operations that remain in the context of Ivy Tech libraries.

Fourth, the librarians reported the need for greater cooperation in the utilization of electronic resources both within Ivy Tech and with external agencies. Fifth, the librarians reported that control of some factors related to the operation of Ivy Tech\'s libraries has shifted to external agencies.

The literature suggests that they have been slow to adopt those responsibilities. This study was conducted to determine the extent to which Michigan school library media specialists have implemented the Information Power teaching and instructional partnering responsibilities, which variables might predict the implementation of those responsibilities, and which variables might prevent school library media specialists from teaching and partnering more. The results of previous research regarding the extent to which the two responsibilities has been implemented are inconsistent, and no research has been found that studied the ability of variables to predict school library media specialists\' teaching and instructional partnering practice.\r\n\r\nA mixed-methods approach consisting of a survey and interviews was used to collect the data needed to answer five research questions. The survey consisted of a questionnaire designed following Dillman\'s Tailored Design Method around the four Information Power responsibilities of school library media specialists and participants\' demographic information. Response items consisted of specific activities following Information Power and Loertscher\'s school library media specialist taxonomy. The questionnaire was mailed to a stratified random sample of Michigan schools. Nine participants were selected randomly from the tails and center of the response distribution based on their Rasch-scaled responses. Those participants were interviewed to validate the survey data and to supplement the study with qualitative data.\r\n\r\nThe Rasch-scaled responses to the survey were analyzed using multiple regression analysis. The data indicated that 69.7 percent of participants reported at least some teaching, and 71.6 percent reported at least some instructional partnering. Variables that predicted the extent of participants\' teaching were whether or not participants were certified as school library media specialists, the extent to which they served as program administrator and as instructional partner, and whether or not they held a bachelor\'s degree in a field other than library and information science or educational media. Participants\' preferred level of involvement as information specialist and instructional partner, as well as their actual extent as program administrator and teacher, and certification as school library media specialists predicted increased levels of instructional partnering. Lack of funding for materials and serving as an elementary school library media specialist were associated with lower levels of instructional partnering. The study results support previous research indicating that certification is correlated with more school library media specialist teaching and instructional partnering.

Other matters related to statistics programs for public school libraries were also sought: (a) how frequently the statistics are (should be) collected, (b) what types of survey forms are (should be) used to collect the statistics, and (c) the purposes for which the statistics are (should be) collected. The need for this study developed from statements in professional literature which implied that all state education departments should collect public school library statistics and collect them in such a manner as would make them useful at the state level nationwide.\r\n\r\nState involvement in the collection of such statistics was found to vary considerably from state to state. Fifteen states collect no public school library statistics. Of the thirty-five collecting states, some collect only a few types whereas others collect a variety. Most of those collected are of the \"traditional\" types (i.e., expenditures, budget/income, collections, personnel). Over two-thirds of the statistics are gathered annually and most are collected through the use of the combined form (a form used to collect all kinds of school statistics at one time) rather than through the use of the separate form (a form used to collect school library statistics exclusively).\r\n\r\nMost of the specific statistics highly recommended by the respondents to be collected by state agencies were also of the \"traditional\" types, including \"total amount expended for library,\" \"number of library personnel by type,\" and \"number of students served.\" However, some \"programmatic\" and \"impact\" statistics were recommended. Annual collection of the statistics and the use of the combined form were highly favored.\r\n\r\nIt was recommended that state departments of education should consider the feasibility of establishing regular in-state statistics programs for public school libraries that would be of benefit to all states.','Library science','School administration','','0','8924302'),(478,'Enhancing learning through library and information services in K-12 education: A future search conference','DT',1995,'Baldwin, Margaret Kearns','Ed.D.','Seattle University','','','','','','','','','','','','','United States','Seattle University','United States','data collection','','','http://login.ezproxy.library.ualberta.ca/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/304260334?accountid=14474','Changes in education today are many and intense: governance issues, societal demands, the influx of technology, and ever-present budgeting problems. Library media professionals are rarely involved in the ongoing dialogue of change in education. In an effort to bring this group of educators into that dialogue, a statewide future search conference, a specific whole systems approach to planning, was held in Washington state in October 1994. The thirty-two conference participants represented eight stakeholder groups (four in each group): library media specialists, principals, administrators, university educators, teachers, business representatives, technology experts, and students. The participants addressed the following question: \"What can we do through information systems to most effectively enhance learning in K-12 schools in Washington state in the next five years?\"\r\n\r\nThe conference, which was facilitated by an outside consultant, was a modification of the future search conference models outlined in Weisbord\'s Discovering Common Ground (Weisbord et al., 1992) and Spencer\'s (1989) Winning Through Participation. The future search conference methodology was specifically chosen to provide the opportunity for a wide variety of stakeholders to share their individual perceptions of where information services fit into the larger picture of the future of the educational system and how information specialists should most effectively direct their energies. Coming with their own individual perceptions, then, the stakeholders worked toward \"discovering a common ground\" or a common vision.\r\n\r\nThe message of the Washington conference was clear: Information services personnel should be an integral part of the ongoing dialogue of change in education today. Three recommendations flow from this study. First, information about the successful future search conference model needs to become more widespread in education. Second, the library media professionals must see themselves as collaborative workers and change agents in education. Third, and most important, pre-service training for education personnel at all levels needs to change. Training programs for principals must provide more organizational development training and should train them to understand more fully the potential of the library media specialist as a partner.

A Delphi study technique was utilized to gather data to determine effects automation is having on academic libraries.\r\n\r\nFindings and conclusions. Automation is effecting academic libraries. Budgets are larger due to an increase in maintenance costs and a need for more equipment and computer supplies. It is imperative that library personnel obtain ongoing computer training, become computer literate, and be prepared for an increase in workload. Library users are now able to find materials more quickly and enjoy being able to know if something is checked out.

Dissatisfaction about the physical layout, the collections, the user/circulation service, and the personnel of elementary school libraries was reported by the four targeted groups. Responses to this investigator\'s field studies and surveys were compared with the recommendations suggested in the Chinese standards of practice: Elementary School Facilities Standards (Ministry of Education, Taiwan, 1981), and the most updated American standards: Information Power: Guidelines for School Library Media Programs (AASL, 1988). Literature that studied cases in Taiwan, Canada, Great Britain, and the United States was reviewed to provide reference and support for this study.\r\n\r\nThe results of the study indicate that, in most cases, elementary classroom teachers in Taiwan are assigned the responsibility for library operation, in addition to their major teaching responsibility, despite the fact that few had any library training prior to this assignment. The finding suggests that Taiwan has not yet concluded that the library and librarians are an important adjunct of the learning process.\r\n\r\nThat prospective teachers should receive adequate library training in their preparation program, as other surveys had suggested, was also affirmed by this study. Library training for prospective teachers can help them not only to possess the necessary background to help their future students but also to help themselves, as prospective teachers, become better (and more capable) library users.\r\n\r\nThe study recommends the revision, updating, and reinforcement of the Chinese elementary school library standards. Programs should be established to train and certify people who are interested in working at elementary school libraries. A technical service center should be established so that direct contacts with users by library staff can be their primary concern.','Library science','Elementary education','Teacher education','0','9110224'),(483,'Information retrieval from on-line databases by students in secondary school library media centers','DT',1988,'Washington, MaryAnn Showers','Ed.D.','Temple University','','','','','','','','','','','','','United States','Temple University','United States','survey','','','http://login.ezproxy.library.ualberta.ca/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/303708319?accountid=14474','Eighty-five secondary school library media specialists in Pennsylvania were surveyed about information retrieval from online databases by students in secondary school library media centers. The library media specialists surveyed managed sites funded for student searching of online databases by the state under the LIN-TEL (Linking Information Needs-Technology, Education, Libraries) project.\r\n\r\nThe study included search activities for 1985-1986 and investigated what databases were used, how the databases were utilized in curriculum areas, what training programs were in place, and the problems and potential library media specialists attached to online database searching by students. A profile of search sites collected data about staff, equipment, searching, and LIN-TEL membership.\r\n\r\nThe LIN-TEL project was devised to train library media specialists about online searching and provide limited funding for searching by students. The issues of database selection, retrievability of documents, and demands on staff time were identified by respondents as interrelated issues impacting on student searching.\r\n\r\nLibrary media specialists reported the major hindrance to online database searching at their sites was lack of staff time. When the financial support of the LIN-TEL project is withdrawn, respondents anticipated the major hindrance to searching would become funding.

An attempt was made to determine if there are significant differences in the role expectations for directors of learning resources programs held by college presidents, academic deans, faculty, and directors. Differences in role expectations among the respondents with respect to age, degree earned, state where employed, years employed by a two-year institution, and size of college were also examined.\r\n\r\nA 36-item questionnaire was created and mailed to all presidents, deans, and directors, and to eight faculty members on each campus of all comprehensive community colleges in Kentucky, Alabama, Tennessee, and Virginia. Demographic data were also collected. The faculty members from Kentucky were randomly selected, but, since lists of faculty were not available for the other three states, presidents in Alabama, Tennessee, and Virginia were asked to distribute questionnaires to their faculty. Of the 780 questionnaires mailed, 395 or 51% were returned.\r\n\r\nFactor analysis identified eight factors or themes. The responses regarding the perceived importance of each of the factors were compared by the use of analysis of variance. In order to ascertain if there were significant differences between the four groups of participants, the data were then analyzed using planned comparisons. Three hypotheses were formulated and tested. One comparison assessed differences between administrators/directors and faculty; one assessed differences between directors and other administrators; and one assessed differences between presidents and academic deans. Only the first comparison, which assessed differences between administrators/directors and faculty, revealed significant differences in the areas of instructional activities, policy making activities, planning activities, college-wide activities, and faculty activities. Differences were found on seven of the eight factors with administrators/directors generally holding higher expectations than faculty.\r\n\r\nAnalysis of variance was utilized to determine if demographic data would be a confounding variable. No significant differences were found with the exception of planning activities as related to degree earned and formal teaching activities as related to state of employment. Respondents with doctoral degrees rated planning activities as being significantly more important than did respondents with master\'s, bachelor\'s, and other degrees. Respondents from Alabama rated formal teaching activities as being significantly more important than respondents from the other states.','Library science','Community colleges','School administration','0','9403143'),(485,' Adult-adolescent service encounters: The library context','DT',1997,'Chelton, Mary Katherine','Ph.D.','Rutgers The State University of New Jersey - New Brunswick','','','','','','','','','','','','','United States','Rutgers The State University of New Jersey - New Brunswick','United States','interview ','','','http://login.ezproxy.library.ualberta.ca/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/304387778?accountid=14474','This study provides an interpretive analysis of the \"place\" of the adolescent as a social construct and individual agent within the context of library theory and practice. In particular, this dissertation addresses how self and identity are constituted in library theory and practice in relation to the adolescent. Through use of a constitutive theory of communication grounded in the interactive definition of the situation, the examination of these issues aims to show the relevance of concerns with self and identity in the theorizing of the library and its users. Particular research questions addressed include: (1) How the definition of the service situation is accomplished; (2) How the definition of the service situation may be influenced by stereotypic expectations or a theory of practice; (3) How age as a social category enters into the definition of the service situation; (4) How adolescent \"information needs\" are perceived by and responded to by service providers; and (5) Whether the definition of the service situation in library encounters constructs a sense of place in the wider community for adolescent users.\r\n\r\nFindings include service as a multi-dimensional concept in libraries not totally congruent with theories or standards of practice. Information \"facilitator\" and \"coach\" are observed service roles more than \"information retriever.\" These roles, however, do not necessarily carry over to other kinds of interactive encounters in this setting. Asymmetrical knowledge and power relationships are normalized in the library context, in part because of the conventional interview structure of most interactions. Expectations of user competence are embedded in practice assumptions. Relational work is inhibited by role expectations and negative attributions to adolescents\' personal appearance by library staff, the clustering and short length of many service encounters, and age-stigmatization. Adolescent \"information needs\" are defined by adult library staff as self-identified queries, and by adolescents as a need for respect. The latter is often thwarted by organizational expectations of users and arrangements for compliant behavior control.','Library science','Educational sociology','Social studies education','0','9814054'),(486,'Role Expectations for School Library Media Specialists: A Collective Case Study of Two Medium-Sized Wisconsin School Districts','DT',2013,'Lea, Mark Keith','Ph.D.',' The University of Wisconsin - Madison','','','','','','','','','','','','','United States',' The University of Wisconsin - Madison','United States','interview ','','','http://login.ezproxy.library.ualberta.ca/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1444319403?accountid=14474','During this period of radical change in the field of information technology there is evidence of confusion about the role of school library media specialists in the implementation, and the administration of emerging information technologies in Wisconsin public schools.\r\n\r\nThis study sought to answer the question what is the role of the school library media specialist (SLMS) in Wisconsin public schools?\r\n\r\nIn-depth interview methodology was used to discover role expectations for workers in the area of information and instructional technologies.

Previous research on the historical development of public schooling has generally ignored these areas. Further hindering research in these areas was the fact that foundational studies in library history and educational technology have generally ignored or only briefly addressed the development of programs at the level of secondary education.\r\n\r\nThis study traced the evolution of the school library and technology programs at New Trier High School from the school\'s inception in 1899 until 1997. The study answered what were the key issues surrounding the development of these programs throughout the twentieth century and the events, which either hindered or supported further program development. The study articulates the key national initiatives, standards or other developments upon which the progress of the New Trier programs can be evaluated. The technology program includes educational museums, audiovisual programs, instructional radio, instructional television and computer-aided instruction in addition to administrative computing issues.\r\n\r\nThe recommendation for practicing educators from this study is to be aware of the inherent value of their own institution\'s heritage and develop policies and practices to preserve that history for the future. Suggestions for further research include: additional case study histories of individual schools or districts for comparison; deeper research into the specific programs outlines including the educational museum movement, the impact of the ITFS program on instruction, and the early use of computer technology at the elementary and secondary level; work regarding the development of elementary school library programs, specifically prior to 1966; a survey of archival materials available to researcher of secondary education issues and the indexing large or significant collections of twentieth century secondary school newspapers.','School administration','Library science','Educational software','0','3056403'),(488,'Content Specific Classroom Libraries in a Middle School Setting','DT',2011,'Ray, Stacy T.','Ed.D.','Missouri Baptist University','','','','','','','','','','','','','United States','Missouri Baptist University','United States','comparisons ','','','http://login.ezproxy.library.ualberta.ca/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/922419013?accountid=14474','In September of 2008 Scholastic Book Company donated content specific classroom libraries to one core team of sixth grade classrooms at Wentzville Middle School in the Wentzville School District.

The tension between providing students with First Amendment rights and maintaining an orderly school environment is a fundamental issue of board governance. Further, the governing board has a responsibility to promote a commitment by students to their community and to local values, illustrating the need to balance law and community values in forming policy for the adoption and removal of books in public school libraries. The balance between law and community values is the subject of this study.\r\n\r\nThe methodological approach employed in this inquiry was two-pronged. Initially, the inquiry encompassed a legal analysis of statutory law, constitutional law, and school policy using standard legal research techniques. Second, a multiple case study of school governing boards in urban, rural, and suburban districts was completed through means of a questioning protocol. Qualitative analysis techniques were used to compare statutory and constitutional law, existing local school policy, and interview data collected during focus group sessions with governing board members. Triangulation of data from the three sources revealed emergent patterns. These patterns provided school communities with information, and inspired a chart that may prove useful in future development of policy as well as in refining the decision-making processes.\r\n\r\nSeven themes emerged from the data analysis process. They included (a) students\' right to free speech; (b) ideology considerations (Establishment Clause); (c) federal law; (d) state statutes; (e) students\' right to receive information regarding book adoption and removal considerations; (f) the influence of the community on board operations; and, (g) policy considerations. Of the three research questions that guided the study, the first two were answered by the themes imbedded in the data.

Due to funding issues, many schools have been forced to reduce the number of library media specialists or library staff, reduce the amount of books added to library collections, and in some extreme cases, schools have been forced to close school library doors. The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship of student academic achievement to variables related to the operation and supervision of school library media centers. The independent variables of school library media centers investigated were library collection size, library visits and book checkouts, and the services delivered by library media specialists in selected school library media centers throughout school districts in West Tennessee. Specifically, this study examined the dependent variable of standardized test scores in the area of Reading as measured on the Tennessee Comprehensive Assessment Program (TCAP) for students in grades 3, 5, and 8. The sample consisted of 47 West Tennessee elementary and middle schools libraries. These school libraries were associated with schools that contained students in grades 3, 5, and 8. The research questions explored were: (1) Does collection size (number of books, magazines, and audio-visual items) in a school library media center affect the results of student performance as measured by Reading scores on the TCAP in schools located throughout West Tennessee? (2) Does the number of student visits to the library media center and the number of books checked out by students influence the reading achievement as measured by Reading scores on the TCAP of students in schools located throughout West Tennessee? And (3) Do the services performed by library media specialists impact student achievement as measured by Reading scores on the TCAP of students in schools located throughout West Tennessee?

The six professional roles of 21st century school librarians were that of instructional partner, technology leader, school improvement facilitator, collection manager, literacy leader, and advocate. To examine the perceptions of administrators and school librarians with regard to the professional roles, the researcher conducted a sequential mixed methods study of one public school district in Louisiana.\r\n\r\nThe study consisted of two phases; the first phase included a pair of surveys sent to participating administrators and school librarians, prompting them to rate the importance and frequency of various tasks associated with the professional roles. The second phase included an interview protocol designed as a follow-up to build upon and complement the participants’ feedback to the surveys. The data were analyzed for triangulation purposes and to answer the overarching research question: “To what extent are there differences between administrators’ and school librarians’ perceptions of school librarians’ professional roles in school improvement in the TLK Public School System?”\r\n\r\nAs a result of data collection and analyses, it was found that not only did administrators and school librarians share similarities in their perceptions with regard to the professional roles, but they also agreed on various reasons for identifying school librarians as additional educational leaders. The administrators and school librarians indicated that the various tasks and professional roles of school librarians were either important or highly important, and they were completed on a regular basis.\r\n\r\nThe results of the study were generalized to the population, which was all administrators and school librarians employed in the public school system of study.

Many students believe they are knowledgeable about using computers, but cannot demonstrate good information literacy skills. Because teachers often feel they do not have sufficient time to effectively teach such skills, and because students need help when teachers are unable to assist them, this study addresses how information literacy skills can be scaffolded through pages on a high school library Web site.\r\n\r\nProblems students encounter while completing research projects were identified by teachers of English, English Language Learners, and Special Education students in a high school suburb of Chicago. Identified problems were separated into those that would not be addressed in the study, those that could be satisfied through links to existing Web pages, and those that would be created. Four types of scaffolding were incorporated into the design of the pages that were created: conceptual, metacognitive, procedural, and strategic. Pages for the library Web site were planned and designed to address identified needs and provide those four types of scaffolding. Staff members and students gave comments as they reviewed the pages; those comments were used in the revision process.

This dissertation presents the theory and model of the informationally underserved (IU). These are students who learn in classrooms with neither books nor information literacy instruction that support academic achievement and individual interests and readiness levels.\r\n\r\nThe deconstruction of this social justice issue employed concurrent mixed-methods research procedures through a cultural pragmatic lens to answer these research questions: Is academic performance compromised if students are without an active school library program? Do students without access to school libraries in elementary and middle school perform significantly less than proficient on standardized tests? How, if at all, do students without active school library programs characterize their information worlds and everyday information practices with their academic performance? In what ways does the lack of library use prior to 9th grade impact a student\'s intellectual desire for knowledge?\r\n\r\nThe school library impact studies (SLIS) (Baughman, J., 2000; Lance, 2000; Achterman, D. L., 2008; Kachel, 2011; LRS, 2013) provide ample data regarding the positive impact of active school library programs (ASLP) on standardized test achievement. However, there is little research from student perspectives or on the opposite: Whether or not little or no access to ASLP prior to high school has a relationship with poor standardized test performance. The quantitative research adopts the SLIS model, but surveys students. Independent variables include middle and elementary school library availability, frequency of use, and public library use. The results show a slight to modest, but not significant, correlation between students without school libraries and “needs improvement” or “warning” standardized test scores.\r\n\r\nThe concurrent module investigates the phenomenon of the possible marginalization of those educated without libraries. Thirty minute, semi-structured interviews queried students without ASLP about their conceptualizations of their information use within the small world of the school classroom, the meso world of school, and their information worlds (IW) (Jaeger & Burnett, 2010). Everyday information seeking, use and practices (EIP) (Savolainen, 2008) also serve as coding themes. The IU describe classroom learning resources as textbooks, guided reading books and limited free reading books. Access to technology is intermittent. Little or no information literacy instruction is offered. They tend to use family members, public libraries and book stores to locate non-school related information.\r\n\r\nBy triangulating IW and EIP theories with SLIS survey methodology, a three dimensional, holistic theory emerges. The results express a dynamic problem that equates “social justice” with “intended consequences” (Creswell, 2003, p. 12). The replicable informationally underserved theory and model may be used to study other populations in order to strengthen the SLIS research and enlarge the foundational theories. The goal is to inform educational decision makers about the “ethical consideration(s) of funding school libraries, which “lead to actions based on principles of equal access to information, balance in library collections, and mediation between information seekers and content” (Budd, J., 2001). The purpose is increase access to school libraries in order to advance student empowerment.','Library science','Middle School education','Elementary education','0','3583495'),(494,'The development of the partnership between the American Library Association and the National Council for Accreditation of Teacher Education','DT',2010,'Gann, Linda A.','Ph.D.','The University of Oklahoma','','','','','','','','','','','','','United States','The University of Oklahoma','United States','interviews ','','','http://login.ezproxy.library.ualberta.ca/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/613900058?accountid=14474','This qualitative study examined the development of the partnership between the American Library Association (ALA) and the National Council for Accreditation of Teacher Education (NCATE).

Critical pedagogical theory was employed as the conceptual framework. Twelve secondary school librarians from 12 distinct school systems participated in multiple interviews, which were analyzed to examine the extent to which the librarians self-censored and the potential effects their actions had upon the schools\' \"others.\"\r\n\r\nThe findings indicated that most participants did in fact self-censor, particularly regarding books with homosexual themes. Although they expressed compassion and concern for the student \"others,\" their feelings failed to translate into action. Most of the librarians refused to purchase potentially controversial titles that would be beneficial to these students.\r\n\r\nImplications for school librarians included providing them a means to reflect upon their own beliefs versus practices; to evaluate their reflections against the participants\' to gain awareness of their potential to oppress students; and to open a space to discuss the possibilities of employing the principles of critical pedagogy in their library programs.\r\n\r\nImplications for school library media education included further study of the extent to which critical pedagogical theory is incorporated into the school library media curriculum. It was determined that interviews with pre-service school librarians to gauge their preparedness and willingness to address intellectual freedom and social equity would be beneficial as well.\r\n\r\nAn investigation of the availability of LGBTQ literature in the schools should be undertaken to establish whether this group of students is equitably represented. Titles should be analyzed to determine if the characters are portrayed accurately or if they are pathologized.\r\n\r\nIn addition to interviewing librarians, a study of marginalized students\' attitudes toward the library media center and its offerings would enable librarians to better understand and serve this largely silent population. Achieving social equity and intellectual freedom is integral to the transformation of the school library media center into a safe space for those who need it most.

Recent estimates report that one in 68 children has been diagnosed with autism, with ASD affecting one in 42 boys and one in 189 girls (CDC, 2014). The purpose of this case study was to determine the effectiveness of a video peer modeling and least-to-most prompting intervention targeting the instructional delivery of an information literacy skill to students with ASD in the school library setting. Research studies have evaluated the effectiveness of video modeling procedures in the acquisition of social initiation, conversational skills, perspective-taking, appropriate play, and functional skills. However, the literature is limited on the effects of video modeling with least-to-most prompting on the acquisition of academic skills in library instructional programs. This research study is significant due to the rapid increase in the identification of students with autism spectrum disorders and current inclusionary practices in both the general education and library classrooms. This single-subject, multiple case study design utilized a descriptive approach to measure baseline, video peer-modeling intervention, and withdrawal phases for the acquisition of skills by five middle school students with autism spectrum disorder in accessing an online computer card catalog to locate a library book in the school collection. The primary question this research study sought to answer was: How does the use of video modeling accompanied by least-to-most prompting affect the acquisition of library information skills in students with autism spectrum disorder (ASD)? The results suggest that video modeling with least-to-most prompting was successful in teaching the five participants to access the online library card catalog to help them select books for academic and leisure activities. The video modeling intervention effectively facilitated the acquisition of the targeted skill for all of the study participants.

Predictor variables included (a) library collection size, (b) library visits and book checkouts, and (c) the services delivered by librarians in 189 schools in Tennessee. The criterion variable in the study was students\' standardized test scores in Reading as measured by the Tennessee Comprehensive Assessment Program (TCAP) for students in grades 3 through 8. Control variables included enrollment, attendance, economically disadvantaged, and non-minority data from each school. This study replicated a study undertaken by Crafford (2006) in West Tennessee school libraries. The 3 research questions were: (1) Does collection size (number of books, magazines, and audio-visual items) in a school library media center affect the results of student performance as measured by Reading scores on the TCAP in schools located throughout Tennessee? (2) Does the number of student visits to the library media center and the number of books checked out by students influence the reading achievement as measured by Reading scores on the TCAP of students in schools located throughout Tennessee? (3) Do the services performed by library media specialists impact student achievement as measured by Reading scores on the TCAP of students in schools located throughout Tennessee? Coupled with Crafford\'s West Tennessee study, there was corroborating evidence for statistically significant data found to support that collection size does impact TCAP Composite Reading Test Scores in grades 3 through 8 in Tennessee schools. This also substantiates Lance\'s (1993, 2005) Colorado studies and especially his Illinois (2005) study where a major finding was the relationship of collection size to student achievement.','Library science','Elementary education','Secondary education','0','3320219'),(499,'Professional school librarians as transformational leaders','DT',2007,'Long, Mary Frances Muha','Ed.D.','Nova Southeastern University','','','','','','','','','','','','','United States','Nova Southeastern University','United States','data collection','','','http://login.ezproxy.library.ualberta.ca/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/304717055?accountid=14474','This applied dissertation used a cross-sectional survey design to collect data about the leadership-style preferences and performance of school librarians in the United States who worked in elementary or secondary schools. The purpose of the study was to determine whether there was a correlation between the leadership-style preference of school librarians and their level of performance as educational and technological leaders on the curriculum and instructional team. Bass\'s (1985) theory on transformational leadership provided the theoretical framework. The population frame was 1,000 school librarians randomly selected from the database of Market Data Retrieval. Data were collected using Bass and Avolio\'s (1995) Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire (Form 5x-Short) Leadership Form and an additional data sheet that contained closed-ended questions regarding the participants\' self-perceived performance of the roles prescribed in Information Power: Building Partnerships for Learning (AASL L& AECT, 1998). Data were analyzed to see if school librarians who have a preference for the transformational-leadership style were performing as educational and technological leaders in the curriculum and instructional role as prescribed in Information Power. Results indicated that school librarians who have a preference for transformational leadership were performing their prescribed roles at a high level (3.2 mean).\r\n\r\nThis study\'s primary contribution to theory and practice was to highlight the transformational role of school librarians. Limitations of this study were that participants self-rated their leadership characteristics and performance as professionals.

The researcher uses the institutional ethnography frame of inquiry, providing a way of looking at the role and function of the school librarian/ school media specialist as socially-organized and institutionally-oriented. Using ethnographic data gathering techniques of interviews, participant-observation, and textual analysis in a middle school in the Midwestern United States, the researcher describes social organization of school library work in the categories of collaboration, technology, and access. Viewing school library work through the institutional ethnography frame of reference reveals how powerless media specialists and teachers can be—how the structures that are supposed to make the non-instructional and disciplinary parts of their work easier consume their time and affect their interactions with students.\r\n\r\nIn an apparently uncertain economic climate, where libraries face closure due to state, city, and school district budget problems the existence of a library in the school becomes even more vital, both to provide access to information to young people and to keep the ideal of the library present in their experience. The visibility of the library and the librarian is also vital. People who make decisions about funding need to know who the librarian is and what he or she contributes. Institutional ethnography shows people where the work is, especially the work that is not recognized in the official institutional discourse. With the knowledge of how the work is shaped, school librarians can get a clearer view of how to work within the institution to achieve the goals of librarianship: providing physical and intellectual access to information.','Library science','Middle School education','School Administration','0','3458968'),(501,'Using large -scale assessments to evaluate the effectiveness of school library programs in California','DT',2004,'Sinclair-Tarr, Stacy L','Ed.D.','Pepperdine University','Tarr, William W., Jr','','Pepperdine University','','','','','','','','','','United States','Pepperdine University','United States','Survey','','','http://login.ezproxy.library.ualberta.ca/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/305034169?accountid=14474','This California statewide study examined the relationship between the presence of school libraries, as defined by credentialed staffing, and student achievement, as measured by both criterion-referenced and norm-referenced assessments. The 2001 reauthorization of the 1965 Elementary and Secondary Education Act, the No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB), mandates increased student achievement in K-12 schools and districts as a condition for receiving federal monies. Because the accountability provisions under NCLB focus on what students have learned rather than on what is taught, an outcome-based emphasis has created the need to quantitatively determine the effectiveness of specific programs.\r\n\r\nUsing the School Characteristics Index (SCI) to compare schools with similar demographics, statistically significant positive relationships were found between the presence of a school library and student achievement on all CST assessments at the elementary and middle school levels. Statistically significant positive relationships were also found between the presence of a school library and student achievement on all elementary CAT-6 (Survey) assessments and on the mathematics CAT-6 (Survey) at the middle school level. There were no statistically significant relationships found between the presence of a school library and student achievement at the high school level.\r\n\r\nFactors within the school library at the elementary and middle school levels were also examined. At the elementary level, the size of the collection, hours of operation, presence of a video collection, types of technology offered, and offering a program of curriculum-integrated skills instruction, were found to have a statistically significant relationship to student achievement. At the middle school level, no specific factor was found to have a statistically significant relationship with student achievement. Recommendations included the need for communicating a clear library vision, working collaboratively across campus, and examining the role of the school library\'s program to support core instructional goals. Further study needs to examine if the same outcomes would result with other definitions of a school library program including noncredentialed staffing.

For many years, there has been concern about the amount of instructional collaboration performed by school librarians. Research from inside school librarianship has most often tried to understand the dynamics of school librarians\' instructional collaboration practices by examining characteristics of the school librarian her or himself. School librarians\' instructional practices, however, are as likely to be affected by school climate as are the instructional practices of classroom teachers. In its shift of focus away from the school librarian to school librarians\' work environments—by applying the findings of research on school reform to research on school librarianship—this study aimed to better understand the instructional collaboration activity of school librarians by examining whether the type of environment in which they worked (as measured by the amount of professional community) affected the amount of instructional collaboration they performed.\r\n\r\nData from a sample of schools involved in the national Library Power Project was used. A summed scale to measure amount of professional community was created. The summed scale was used to measure the amount of professional community reported by each of three groups in the sample: school librarians, classroom teachers, and school principals. Factor analysis showed the scale to be unitary, and Cronbach\'s Alpha scores from .83–.85 indicated that the scale was reliable. Regressions performed to determine whether predictive relationships existed between professional community and the amount of instructional collaboration reported by the three groups showed significant relationships for three out of five research hypotheses.','Library science','Curricula','Teaching','0','9982268'),(503,' The lived experience of Minnesota secondary school library media specialists in an era of educational reform: A dual -method investigation','DT',2004,'Kelsey, Marie Ellen','Ph.D.','The University of Wisconsin - Madison','','','','','','','','','','','','','United States','The University of Wisconsin - Madison','United States','survey','interviews','','http://login.ezproxy.library.ualberta.ca/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/305110106?accountid=14474','The purpose of this study was to investigate the lived experience of Minnesota school library media specialists during the era of the Profile of Learning, a Minnesota educational reform movement between 1994 and 2003. The Profile of Learning defined ten Learning Areas with matching standards and projects designed to help students meet those standards. The projects were resource-based, influencing high levels of media center activity.\r\n\r\nThe study used a combination of quantitative (survey) and qualitative (interviews) methodologies in a hybrid approach to lived experience research to investigate the daily experiences of the media specialists. Among the findings were that instructional and collaborative roles of media specialists increased, administrative and advocacy roles decreased, stress levels among media specialists were high, but stress was defined as “good.” The tasks of instruction and collaboration were estimated to be carried out more than any other task. There were gender differences in a few aspects of the media specialists\' experiences. Women were more likely to engage in instruction and collaboration than men; men were more likely to be involved in technical support activities and administration and were less likely than women to take work home with them.\r\n\r\nWhile many media specialists reported being very active during the Profile era with instruction and collaboration, the interviews revealed that they had to await opportune moments to offer media center services to teachers who were not accepting of the Profile of Learning nor eager to collaborate. To maintain teacher good will, media specialists had to be supportive of the teachers without being affirming of the Profile.\r\n\r\nWhen the Profile of Learning was dissolved in 2003 and replaced by standards focusing on testing, media specialists became concerned about the future of the media center\'s role in student education.\r\n\r\nSuggestions for future research: investigate the affect of the new standards on media center activity; consider what conditions might promote public relations and advocacy activities; investigate teacher perceptions of media specialists and why they are so reluctant to collaborate, even when conditions support and encourage this activity; and investigate the implications of the gender issues identified in this study.','Library science','Secondary education','','0','3155064'),(504,'Benign neglect: Principals\' knowledge of and attitudes towards school library media specialists','DT',2006,'Kaplan, Allison G.','Ed.D.','University of Delaware','','','','','','','','','','','','','United States','University of Delaware','United States','survey ','','','http://login.ezproxy.library.ualberta.ca/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/305325168?accountid=14474','A school library media specialist once told me that she is always a heartbeat away from a good school library media program because as soon as she \"trains\" one principal, that principal moves on and she has to \"train\" another one.

University libraries are, of course, organizations. Inside these organizations the managers make a variety of decisions that will have a significant impact on the success of those libraries. Libraries\' managers utilize different methods in processing their decisions. Many factors play roles in the success of libraries\' managers. The manager\'s managerial decision style is one factor that contributes to the success of the manager and therefore to the success of their organization; and yet, there is a dearth of research about decision styles used in library administration and how they influence the decision-making process.\r\n\r\nThe main purpose of this study was to explore the managerial decision styles of the managers (directors, associate directors, assistant directors, and the heads of departments) of Florida\'s state university libraries. A second purpose was to determine the relation between the variety of managers\' decision styles and the following seven variables: gender, age, ethnicity, educational level, educational major, administrative experience, and current position. The results of this study will provide baseline information to improve our understanding of library managers and management.\r\n\r\nThis study was grounded in the Decision Style Model developed by Alan Rowe and Richard O. Mason (1987). A survey questionnaire was employed in this study. The questionnaire included two parts: (1) “The Decision Style Inventory” (DSI) developed by Row and Mason (1987). This inventory was applied to measure the decision styles of the managers of Florida\'s state university main libraries. (2) The second part of the questionnaire consisted of questions designed to obtain descriptive data such as gender, age, ethnicity, educational level, educational major, current position, and administrative experience.\r\n\r\nAccording to the Decision Style Model, it was found that the predominant decision style for the majority of Florida\'s state university main libraries\' managers was the behavioral decision style, followed by the conceptual decision style. The directive decision style was the style used least often by most of these managers. As for the decision style patterns, the findings inform us that the majority of Florida\'s state university main libraries\' managers think using the right side of the brain rather than the left side.\r\n\r\nIt was also found that there was no relationship was found between Florida\'s state university libraries\' managers and their gender, age, or highest academic degree. On the other hand, the findings of this study indicated that years of administrative experience, ethnicity, position, and educational major of these managers were indeed related to the decision style or styles used by these managers.\r\n\r\nTo date there has been no research conducted on profiling the decision styles of Florida\'s state university libraries\' managers and the process of how they think in order to reach their decisions.

Traditionally, these students continue in full-time study until their coursework is completed. Distance learning is part of a trend toward developing nontraditional programs to meet the needs of a changing student population. Library support is an essential part of any academic program, including those offered through distance learning. The purpose of this study was to determine if the general academic libraries of The Texas A&M University System (TAMUS) serve the information needs of graduate students enrolled in distance learning courses within the TAMUS member institutions.\r\n\r\nThis study consisted of two parts: a structured interview with librarians and a survey questionnaire administered to graduate students. A structured interview was conducted with librarians to collection information on existing library services provided to distance learners, institutional support provided for library distance learning programs, and the role of assessment and planning in the library services delivered to distance learners. Additionally, a survey of a selected distance learning graduate student population was conducted to assess the information needs of a selected segment of the distance learning graduate student population as well as evaluate their awareness of and satisfaction with existing library services for distance learners.\r\n\r\nAnalysis of the data collected provided the following findings. In general, library practices do provide support for distance learning students; however, the extent of these services varies from institution to institution. The services provided are primarily those available through the Internet indicating that the libraries have not made genuine adaptations in their services to meet the needs of distance learning students. The data from the graduate student questionnaire suggest that, in general, most students do not perceive that the library at the institution at which they are enrolled meets their information needs.\r\n\r\nAs distance learning continues to expand and develop, innovative methods must be found to provide information resources to students studying at a distance.

In more recent years, decreases in university budgets forced academic libraries to rely more heavily on philanthropy in order to operate or expand collections. However, much remains unknown about many aspects of academic library fund raising. This study expands knowledge regarding library development efforts so that scholars and library administrators can better understand library fund raising and become more successful in raising funds.\r\n\r\nDevelopment work for academic libraries has shown to differ from other forms of development activities on a campus due to the fact that donors to academic libraries tend to differ from other kinds of donors on a campus. This research highlights strategies academic library development officers believe work in cultivating donors from a limited target population and how they believe this differs or is similar from the work of other development officers in higher education. This research sought to understand how organizational placement of the library development officer in the university has an impact on successful fund raising.\r\n\r\nThis study used a phenomenological approach involving interviews with library development officers from academic institutions. Participants in the study were selected from library development officers at Association of Research Libraries (ARL) members. An initial e-mail was sent to all the qualifying members of this group asking their opinion on which institutions have the most successful fund raising operations. From this list of exemplary programs, eight development officers were selected for phone interviews. Questions addressed include how library development officers described their roles, how library development officers described the development process, what was the process for identifying donors, what strategies have development officers found most successful in obtaining donations, what library development officers believed about how donor identification and cultivation differ for library development officers in comparison to non-library development officers on campus, what were the challenges inherent in the role of a library development officer, and did the library development officer believe that the reporting structure of the position has any impact on success.\r\n\r\nFindings include the importance of relationships that the library development officer has with the library director, central development, library staff, and donors. The library development officer has an important role in mentoring the library director and library staff in development work. Using phone and mail campaigns is not very effective for libraries. Library development officers also have a hard time selling scholarships and endowments which non-library development officers on campus have an easier time with. Library development officers also rely more on events to identify and cultivate donors. However, the reporting structure of the library development position seems to have little impact on the success of the position.\r\n\r\nThis study also makes several recommendations. Library development officers and library directors need frequent professional development to make up for a lack of education and preparedness for their roles. Library staff in many positions could benefit from this as well. The library development officer should always strive to better connect with central development while at the same time attempting to better connect with opportunities for endowments. In addition, the placement of donors on library advisory boards is a highly successful practice and it should be widely emulated.','Library science','School administration','','0','3351999'),(508,'Job satisfaction in adult and higher education as perceived by ARL library directors','DT',1993,'Myers, Nancy Lee','Ed.D.','University of South Dakota','','','','','','','','','','','','','United States','University of South Dakota','United States','Questionnaire ','survey ','','http://login.ezproxy.library.ualberta.ca/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/304058232?accountid=14474','The purpose of the study was to collect the perceptions of job satisfaction (general, intrinsic, and extrinsic) of library directors in the Association of Research Libraries (ARL) during the 1992-1993 academic year.

Factors in the working environment contributed to ARL library director burnout and turnover.\r\n\r\nData were collected through the use of the Minnesota Satisfaction Questionnaire Short-Form (MSQ) and a demographic survey form sent to all 120 ARL library directors during the 1992-1993 academic year. Ninety-two questionnaires were returned for a response rate of 77 percent.\r\n\r\nAnalysis of the data found that ARL library directors, when compared with the MSQ normative group, were less satisfied with their jobs.

Descriptive statistics, bivariate correlations, and regression analyses were calculated and the Bonferroni adjustment was applied to significance levels to compensate for errors caused by repeated calculations using the same data.\r\n\r\nSeveral statistically significant relationships were found; notably, negative correlations were found between each of the LibQUAL+™ scores and total library expenditures. The study suggested that higher expectations among library users in large, research libraries led to slightly lower LibQUAL+™ scores. Implications for practice included that survey results should only be used as one component of an assessment strategy, and practitioners might consider the potential role of library marketing or public relations efforts to influence user expectations.

They have asserted that, by offering equal access to the repository of human knowledge despite individual ability to pay for such access, libraries ensure greater opportunity in the capitalist society (Information literacy, 1990).\r\n\r\nLibrarians believe they are in the midst of a new age: the Information Age. Supposing that information is the capital of this new society, they stress that literal access to it is no longer adequate to promote equal access. Rather, people must now become information literate. That is, because the amount of information available to people is growing exponentially, there exists the threat of incapacitation caused by information over-load. Only people who know how to locate, access, evaluate and use information will thrive in this new society. Librarians, particularly those in K–12 schools and colleges and universities, believe that they should teach these skills: that they can best support progressive democracy by preparing information literate citizens, employees, and individuals.

School librarians are continually directed to evolve as leaders in order to address the needs of today’s learners and ensure that they are equipped with the knowledge and skills they need to succeed in the 21st century. Despite the abundance of literature that has suggested the need for and the importance of school librarians to be a proactive leaders in technology integration, this role is one that has been ignored in the research arena and left undefined for school administrators, teachers, and the school librarians themselves, leading to uncertainty concerning how school librarians enact this role in practice.

After development the handbook was reviewed by a preliminary group of reviewers who are experts who have worked closely with system implementation and, in some cases, published on the subject. Following the preliminary review the product was revised and sent to the main group of reviewers consisting of people who were directly involved with an implementation project. Field tests used a Likert-type survey to assess the practicality, usefulness, and potential effectiveness of the handbook.\r\n\r\nThe review of the literature showed that there was no single current tool to help with the implementation project. Input from both sets of reviewers confirmed that the handbook fills a need by bringing together information from many different sources into one easy to use product.\r\n\r\nThe handbook was designed to accomplish two major purposes. One was to present tools, structures, and ideas that could be used to successfully manage a project. Second was to offer suggestions, tips, and ideas concerning aspects that are unique to the implementation of an integrated library system. Emphasis was placed on processes and key decisions that should be made rather than specific hardware and software technologies, record structures, and applications. The concepts in this handbook were tailored for libraries at institutions of higher education.','School administration','Library science','','0','3052562'),(513,'What\'s expected, what\'s required, and what\'s measured: A comparative qualitative content analysis of the national professional standards for school librarians, and their job descriptions and performance evaluations in Florida','DT',2014,'Elkins, Aaron J.','Ph.D.','The Florida State University','','','','','','','','','','','','','United States','The Florida State University','United States','qualitative ','','','http://login.ezproxy.library.ualberta.ca/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1615342501?accountid=14474','School librarians\' essential function of providing access to information, and instruction and guidance in its evaluation, use, production, and communication has endured over a century of change in education, technology, and society\'s access to and use of information. What has changed is how school librarians perform their roles. As the rate of technological change has accelerated, perceptions of school librarians\' roles have not always kept pace. School librarians may base their role perceptions on documentary sources, including professional standards, job descriptions, and performance evaluations. School administrators may have different perceptions of school librarians\' roles, based on their past experiences with school librarians. When expected, perceived, and enacted roles differ, school librarians may experience role ambiguity and conflict. With the number of school librarians in decline, those who remain may experience job insecurity. Feelings of job insecurity combined with the pressure on schools to achieve more with fewer resources may cause school librarians to increase their role performance and experience role overload.

The study investigated the flexible access and school collaboration aspects of the IMPACT grant from the North Carolina Department of Education. The results of the study derived from focus and individual interviews. The effectiveness of the IMPACT grant generated four prominent categories, Creating Conducive Educational Climate; Strengthening the Bond; Assessment and Mutual Respect. The participants acknowledged that the students had ownership over their learning. The participants reported that the use of assessment, evaluating critical analysis, and the validation of students\' personal accomplishments was a means of reflected practice for their learning. The implications of this qualitative study presented a new set of vocabulary to describe the process between the media specialists, teachers, and students using the terminology of strengthening the bond to replace the word collaboration; more accurately describes the relationship between the media specialist, teachers and students. The participants stressed the need for more student involvement by capitalizing on the students\' individual expertise.

According to these studies, effective school library media centers have: (a) a qualified library media specialist, (b) adequate support staff, (c) current and large collections, (d) access to information technology that is integrated into the curriculum, and (e) time for collaboration with the faculty. This study was developed to explore the role of technology in the collaborations between school library media specialists and teachers. Data revealed that interactions between school library media specialists and teachers concerning the use of technology to teach information literacy skills occurred with frequency and in a variety of ways at the three selected exemplary school library media centers. However, barriers sometimes prevented collaboration from resulting. Climate in the school library media center was found to be crucial to collaboration and to the teaching of information literacy skills. Data indicated that technology should be only one of the tools used in teaching of information literacy skills to students, although computer literacy skills are perceived as increasingly important in this effort. According to the data from the surveys, interviews, and observations, teachers perceived the library media specialist to be the person with expertise in both technology and information literacy on their campuses, thereby necessitating involvement in continuing professional development.

This study investigates the perceptions of a fifth grade teacher concerning instructional consultation as she worked with a library media specialist.\r\n\r\nThe research design and implementation are grounded in the theory of cognitive development and learning developed by Lev Semenovich Vygotsky. The study draws on Vygotsky\'s theory to inform existing literature on consultation. Three models of consultation as found in library media literature are discussed and applied to the naturalistic site of a public elementary school.\r\n\r\nThe site for the research was an elementary school set in the southwestern United States in an agricultural community. The research spanned an entire school year with a social studies teacher as she worked with three sections of the fifth grade and the library media specialist.\r\n\r\nData were collected through participant observation, interviews and documents. The constant comparative method of analysis was utilized to compare participant observations fieldnotes, video recordings of classroom and library media center instruction, and audiotaped interviews. One core category, growth, emerged from the analysis along with three complementary categories: growth of a relationship, growth of an environment and growth of persons. These three categories are discussed as framed by the literature, particularly the library media specialist literature and Vygotsky\'s learning theory.\r\n\r\nThese findings have both practical and theoretical significance for the library media community. Primarily, they serve as a guide for library media professionals in the field. Also, they provide the library media community with a theoretical framework for instructional consultation.

The purpose of this study was to describe the perceptions of library media teachers (LMT) and library staff paraprofessionals about the impact of state library funding on library media teachers and library staff paraprofessionals provision of services in school libraries.\r\n\r\nMethodology. The research design used in this study was descriptive ex post facto. Quantitative and qualitative data were collected. Library personnel employed in Fresno County, California, public schools were surveyed to determine the impact of new funding on fifteen variables associated with library service. The survey instrument used a Likert scale to assess impact from minimal to substantial. Responses from library media teachers and paraprofessionals were compared. Open-ended questions were also used to determine presence of facilitators and barriers regarding provision of service.\r\n\r\nFindings and conclusions. A majority of both LMTs and paraprofessionals indicated that the funding substantially impacted their provision of service in the following areas; size of book collection, collection development and planning, budget planning and purchasing guidelines, and resources. Chi-square analysis revealed significant differences between LMTs\' and paraprofessionals\' responses in the following areas: planning, technology, circulation procedures, staff development and training, and teacher collaboration planning. Barriers identified were: funding, lack of adequate support, minimal staffing levels and time constraints. Facilitators identified included; support, funding, and staffing. Five conclusions were drawn from this study: (1) adequate funding enhances services and resource availability for library clients; (2) LMTs are more likely than paraprofessionals to participate in short-term and long-term budget planning; (3) LMTs are more likely than paraprofessionals to ensure technology use, technology purchases, and staff development in technology within the LMC; (4) instructional collaboration between library staff and classroom teachers is enhanced when a LMT works in the library; and (5) the behaviors and actions of site administrators dictate the presence and absence of facilitators and barriers related to the development and improvement of library media programs.\r\n\r\nImplications. Library and site personnel should strive to secure adequate and sustained funding for library media programs. Site administrators should employ LMTs to lead library media programs. Administrators who invest in technology development for their school would benefit from the expertise, knowledge, and services of an LMT.','School administration','School finance','','0','3100046'),(518,'Elementary school principals\' perceptions of the instructional role of the school library media specialist','DT',2007,'Church, Audrey P.','Ph.D.','Virginia Commonwealth University','','','','','','','','','','','','','United States','Virginia Commonwealth University','United States','survey','','','http://login.ezproxy.library.ualberta.ca/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/304706196?accountid=14474','Studies conducted in numerous states by various researchers demonstrate that library media specialists who take an active role in the instructional process positively impact student achievement in their schools.

Principals who responded to the study strongly endorsed the role of library media specialist as teacher of information literacy skills and as instructional partner. There was no statistically significant difference in perceptions based on the type of library schedule in place—fixed, flexible, or mixed/combination. Respondents indicated that they learn about the instructional role of the library media specialist from library media specialists with whom they work, either in their current positions as principals or through their previous experiences as classroom teachers. Principals form their views based on both negative and positive interactions with library media specialists and base their expectations of their current and future library media specialists on these prior experiences and expectations.\r\n\r\nThis finding indicates that school library media specialist preparation programs should prepare their graduates to positively present their key instructional role and that training in this area should be provided for those library media specialists already in the field. Another key finding was that principals place primary responsibility for initiation of collaboration at both the individual teacher and the school level with the library media specialist.

The first objective was to examine the relationship between the attributes of the accreditation related library self-study process and perceived library performance improvement. The second objective was to evaluate the perceived usefulness of the ABA library accreditation standards as evaluative instruments during the accreditation related library self-study and site inspection process.\r\n\r\nThe population of the study comprises law school library directors, law school librarians and law school library site inspectors in all the 120 ABA accredited law schools as listed in the publication entitled, “Official Guide to United States Law Schools, 1998”. No sampling strategy was employed in this study. As such, questionnaires were mailed to law school library directors (120) and law school librarians (120) in all the 120 ABA approved law schools. Thirty questionnaires were mailed to law school site inspectors whose names, designations and official addresses were provided by the ABA.\r\n\r\nEleven research hypotheses were generated for the study\'s first research objective. Only 8 of the 11 research hypotheses were supported by the data. There was no statistically significant relationship between the choice of an appropriate self-study design and perceived library performance improvement (r = .16, p > .05). There was no statistically significant relationship between amount of time taken to complete the self-study process and perceived library performance improvement (r = .19, p > .05). These two independent variables were dropped when a stepwise multiple regression analysis was performed with the dependent variable, perceived library performance improvement. The results of regressing the remaining eight independent variables with perceived library performance improvement show that collectively all the eight independent variables significantly explained the variance in perceived library performance improvement (F = 29.73, R = .66, R Square =.44, p < .0001). However, only two independent variables were included in the stepwise regression model: support from the accrediting agency and motivation to bring changes and improvements among self-study participants.\r\n\r\nSix research hypotheses were generated for the study\'s second research objective.

Although teacher-librarians grapple with developing materials, programs, and resources intended to support increases in high school student information literacy knowledge, students continue to enter higher education with limited skills to support the rigor of academic research (Gross & Latham, 2012). Previous research of Kuhlthau (1991), Bruce (2008) and Oakleaf (2009) focused on information literacy development through motivation, varied experiences, and incremental assessments. Essential to the development of a high school student’s information literacy knowledge is the school’s library program (Eisenberg, 2008). A new perspective to view a high school library program will heighten stakeholder shared support, awareness, responsibility, and expectations, for the development of sustainable information literacy processes and skills that can be viewed and utilized in a new context for transferring and recontextualizing into higher education. This semester long case study examined the perspective of stakeholders within Western High School (pseudonym) in Massachusetts to determine whether the existing library program supports the development of student information literacy skills. The study utilized Wiggins’ (1993) assessment for learning theory and Bickman’s (1987) use of a program theory to evaluate student and library program outcomes. The research determined the library program supported student information literacy growth when librarian and educator objectives were intertwined when creating lesson plans, tasks, guides, assessments, and rubrics.

This paper also presents models and strategies of school library collaborations that must be reinforced by effective professional development. Collaborations that affect student achievement fail when obstacles such as fixed schedules, administrative attitudes, and teacher apathy are not addressed. This study found that while most school LMSs espouse the tenets of the American Association of School Librarians’ Standards for the 21st Century Learner (2007), most still operate 19th and 20th century school libraries. Most teachers view the role of the school LMS to be that of resource manager and not of instructional collaborator who is an expert in information literacy and 21st century instructional technology.

To locate a quality setting, I sought experts\' suggestions, reviewed resources, interviewed librarians, and visited four sites. Of these four sites, I chose the quality setting with the highest percentage of racial diversity within the student population.\r\n\r\nIn response to Snow, Burns, and Griffin\'s (1998) call for more research on fourth grade students, I focused this study on students in this grade level. Using data from Terra Nova scores, teacher ranking, and a Title Recognition Test, I selected six fourth graders, who represented diversity in reading ability, reading experience, race, and gender.\r\n\r\nUsing a sociocultural perspective (Gee, 2001) and Halliday\'s (1980) \"social-functional approach\" (p. 37), I defined literacy for children as learning existing, new, and evolving language and language systems in text and technology; learning about language and language systems in social and cultural settings that are meaningful to the community of learners; learning through language and language systems by understanding the power of words in text and technological contexts. With this established literacy definition, I selected the literacy event as a unit of analysis.\r\n\r\nCollecting and analyzing data were reciprocal processes. During the academic year, I collected data via observations and interviews. There were three distinct types of interviews: post literacy event, with artifacts, and with a library model. I employed an emic perspective to view the literacy events through the experiences and understanding of the participants. Using an etic lens, I applied my understandings of literacy research to analyze the child\'s perspective. To crystallize the findings from the analysis, I created literacy portraits for each participant that aligned with the subsidiary questions.\r\n\r\nIn summarizing the literacy portraits, I found a paradox: Although literacy events were ubiquitous in this quality school library, literacy was rare. Drawing on Swales (1990) theory of discourse communities, I argue that the contradiction may stem from differences in the school library and literacy discourse communities, as well as complexity in defining literacy.','Literacy','Reading instruction','Elementary education','0','3230039'),(529,'Smoothing the information seeking path: Removing representational obstacles in the middle school digital library environment','DT',2002,'Abbas, June Marie','Ph.D.','University of North Texas','','','','','','','','','','','','','United States','University of North Texas','United States','quantitative ','qualitative ','','http://login.ezproxy.library.ualberta.ca/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/305576431?accountid=14474','Middle school student\'s interaction within a digital library is explored. Issues of interface features used, obstacles encountered, search strategies and search techniques used, and representation obstacles are examined. A mechanism for evaluating user\'s descriptors is tested and effects of augmenting the system\'s resource descriptions with these descriptors on retrieval is explored.\r\n\r\nTransaction log data analysis (TLA) was used, with external corroborating achievement data provided by teachers. Analysis was conducted using quantitative and qualitative methods. Coding schemes for the failure analysis, search strategies and techniques analysis, as well as extent of match analysis between terms in student\'s questions and their search terms, and extent of match analysis between search terms and controlled vocabulary were developed.\r\n\r\nThere are five chapters with twelve supporting appendixes. Chapter One presents an introduction to the problem and reviews the pilot study. Chapter Two presents the literature review and theoretical basis for the study. Chapter Three describes the research questions, hypotheses and methods. Chapter Four presents findings. Chapter Five presents a summary of the findings and their support of the hypotheses. Unanticipated findings, limitations, speculations, and areas of further research are indicated.\r\n\r\nFindings indicate that middle school users interact with the system in various sequences of patterns. User groups\' interactions and scaffold use are influenced by the teacher\'s objectives for using the ADL. Users preferred to use single word searches over Boolean, phrase or natural language searches. Users tended to use a strategy of repeating the same exact search, instead of using the advanced scaffolds. A high percent of users attempted at least one search that included spelling or typographical errors, punctuation, or sequentially repeated searches. Search terms matched the DQ\'s in some instantiation 54% of all searches. Terms used by the system to represent the resources do not adequately represent the user groups\' information needs, however, using student generated keywords to augment resource descriptions can have a positive effect on retrieval.','Information Systems','Library science','Educational software','0','3082827'),(530,'An exploration of the impact of scheduling on public secondary school library use','DT',2001,'Cammack, Ann Klinovsky','Ph.D.','Texas Woman\'s University','','','','','','','','','','','','','United States','Texas Woman\'s University','United States',' Independent t-tests','','','http://login.ezproxy.library.ualberta.ca/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/252103499?accountid=14474','This study explored the amount of purposeful use of the school library for secondary English and Social Studies class sections (N = 175) from two comparable secondary schools in North Central Texas, one traditionally scheduled school (N = 82) and one A/B block scheduled school (N = 93). Teacher lesson plans were used to calculate the number of library visits for English and Social Studies class sections. Independent t-tests were used to compare mean differences in library use. The hypothesis, there is a significant difference in the amount of purposeful use of the school library during the school day for a traditionally scheduled and for an A/B block scheduled school, was not supported. The results of the overall independent t-test indicated that there was no significant difference in overall library use between the traditionally scheduled and the block scheduled English and Social Studies class sections (p = .710) at the .05 level. To further explore purposeful library use, individual independent t-tests were conducted for each subject area, revealing that traditionally scheduled English I, II, and U.S. History class sections made significantly more library visits (p = .040; p = .034; p = .035) and A/B block scheduled English III, IV, and Geography class sections (p = .033; p = .012; p = .003) made a significantly greater number of library visits.

The concept of the imposed query acknowledges the fact that people transact questions for each other and that this process needs to be differentiated from self-generated information seeking, that is, the transaction of a question by the person who generated it. This work replicates and extends a pilot study that documented the existence of the imposed query and measured its frequency of occurrence at a school library media center. The replication is literal in that the same cross-sectional approach undertaken in the pilot was used. Circulation transactions were counted and categorized as imposed or self-generated for the period of one week at the pilot site and at two comparable schools. This study extends the original work by including interviews with the school librarian, teachers, and students at the pilot site. The main findings of this dissertation are that year-to-year there was a drop in the prevalence rate of imposed queries at the pilot site, that a relationship between question type and age/grade level persists there, as does a difference by gender in transaction type. Across the three sites the difference in transaction type by gender did not hold up, but the relationship between question type and age/grade level did. One school was very similar to the pilot in its imposed occurrence rate; the other\'s imposed occurrence rate was significantly higher. Women were the primary adult users of these libraries. Teachers were the main imposers, but impositions were also made by the school librarian, parents, and the children themselves. It was found that in the school environment the imposed nature of the question is not necessarily explicit. Teachers used a variety of strategies to help students feel ownership of the question. The provision of context to support inquiry was primary to the process. Children were most hindered by limited reading skills, showed a preference for browsing and known items, and had limited ability to critically assess information. Students used a wider variety of sources for imposed queries than they did for self-generated questions and, for the most part, these sources were provided by the teacher.','Library science','Information Systems','Educational software','0','9905536'),(532,'Public library friends groups: Aims, operations, effectiveness','DT',1992,'Kochoff, Stephen Thomas','D.L.S.','Columbia University','','','','','','','','','','','','','United States','Columbia University','United States','interviews ','examination of documents','','http://login.ezproxy.library.ualberta.ca/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/303986702?accountid=14474','This study was designed to analyze public library friends groups in three distinctive settings: a large urban library (the Free Library of Philadelphia), a small city library (the Meriden Public Library), and a rapidly growing suburban library system (the Montgomery County Department of Public Libraries).\r\n\r\nThe case study method was used to report the findings. Data about the libraries and their friends were gathered through lengthy interviews with all significant participants, and examination of documents such as annual reports. Analysis of the data addressed research questions.\r\n\r\nThe research questions focused on the aims, operations, and effectiveness of friends groups and examined friends in the political process; the types of support the friends provide; the communication process among the friends and their role in publicizing the library; the degree to which members of friends groups represent the socio-economic characteristics of their communities; and the linkages between friends and other voluntary groups.\r\n\r\nThe research indicated that friends groups play a variety of roles dictated by local circumstances. They maintain an independence from the library, yet tailor their actions to the library\'s needs. In two of the three cases, the friends fulfilled a political role and improved the libraries\' municipal funding. In the third location, the friends has had continuous difficulty mounting its private-sector fund-raising program. This study indicated that the size of a community\'s population may influence the friends success. It appears that friends groups make a larger, more immediate, more sustained impact in smaller communities.\r\n\r\nFuture research might consider whether friends groups\' political activities, such as lobbying, can lead to significant increases in library budgets; whether there is some danger that the long-term effects of privatization, through increased reliance on private sector monies obtained from fund raising will lead to diminution of government support; whether friends in large cities and counties are more powerful at the grass roots or neighborhood level than centralized groups whose purview covers many communities; and whether the leadership and support of the library director are essential to the effectiveness of the friends.','Library science','Public administration','School finance','0','9232032'),(533,'Discovering Regalos: A Case Study of Saint Anne\'s Middle School','DT',2013,'May, Nicole Jenks','M.L.I.S.','The University of Wisconsin - Milwaukee','','','','','','','','','','','','','United States','The University of Wisconsin - Milwaukee','United States','interviews','survey','observations','http://login.ezproxy.library.ualberta.ca/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1369007692?accountid=14474','Saint Anne\'s Middle School is a Catholic, bilingual, bicultural, middle school for girls that participates in the Milwaukee Parental School Choice Program.

The students’ social, emotional, and intellectual needs appeared to be met at the school for the most part. The school also exhibited best practices for teaching reading at the middle school level to bilingual students. However, to improve reading, the school would want to consider changing the school’s focus from reading comprehension to reading engagement so that students become lifelong readers. In addition, as schools begin to roll out the new educational framework known as the Common Core, which will change how librarians and teachers present reading, and standardized tests assess reading, it is essential that more time be dedicated to exploring point-of-view in informational texts. Finally, because the students tend to score lower on vocabulary than comprehension in reading assessments, increasing the use of free-reading books to introduce vocabulary may provide further opportunities for students to improve on standardized test scores while teaching a valuable lifelong skill. In sum, even a strong school can improve on reading and language arts instruction, and this project shows ways that teachers and librarians can change their thinking to be ready to implement Common Core and still achieve reading engagement.','Library science','Middle School education','Literacy','0','1537932'),(534,'Publication and citation analysis of disciplinary connections of library and information science faculty in accredited schools','DT',2007,'Pluzhenskaia, Marina A.','Ph.D.','University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign','','','','','','','','','','','','','United States','University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign','United States','citation analysis','','','http://login.ezproxy.library.ualberta.ca/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/304852397?accountid=14474','Multidisciplinarity of LIS faculty is one the prominent trends in LIS education. 37% of faculty members in ALA accredited programs hold advanced degrees in disciplines other than LIS. Little is known about the role these migrants from other fields of study play in LIS research and education. This study strives to fill in this gap by analyzing publication and citation patterns of LIS faculty using citation analysis as a primary method and the Thomson Scientific Web of Knowledge as a main data source. The findings lead to the conclusion that LIS schools\' faculty members with non-LIS doctorates do maintain stronger connections with other disciplines than their colleagues with LIS doctorates. They publish more often in journals from other disciplines and get cited more often by scholars from other fields of study. At the same time, faculty with non-LIS doctorates are active in LIS research as well. Significant fractions of their works are published in LIS journals and they get cited often in LIS scholarly periodicals. Thirty six percent of faculty with non-LIS doctorates hold a Master\'s degree in LIS. They maintain less strong connections with other disciplines than those faculty who hold neither a doctorate nor a Master\'s degree in LIS. Faculty with LIS doctorates also maintain connections with other disciplines. Not as much as faculty with non-LIS doctorates, but they publish in non-LIS periodicals and receive citations from scholars in other disciplines. The field of LIS has connections with a wide variety of disciplines. Disciplines of doctorates of LIS educators represent a wide variety of knowledge domains with prevalence of professional fields, social sciences, humanities, and computer science. Faculty members with either LIS or non-LIS doctorates receive citations from all major knowledge domains. This might signify \"exporting\" qualities of LIS as a discipline. The presence of faculty with non-LIS doctorates has a noticeable impact on the level of multidisciplinarity of the schools\' research production. The ratio between faculty with LIS and non-LIS doctorates is a less significant factor than the actual number of faculty members with non-LIS doctorates in regard to multidisciplinarity of schools\' publications and citations to them.','Library science','Information systems','','0','3270003'),(535,'The relationship between school library media programs and science achievement in Michigan middle schools','DT',2005,'Mardis, Marcia A.','Ed.D.','Eastern Michigan University','','','','','','','','','','','','','United States','Eastern Michigan University','United States','qualitative ','Discussion group','','http://login.ezproxy.library.ualberta.ca/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/305376699?accountid=14474','In 2002, the Michigan School Library Study (MSLS), The Impact of Michigan School Librarians on Academic Achievement: Kids Who Have Libraries Succeed, showed that school library media specialists\' supports, attitudes, and motivations played essential roles in promoting student reading achievement. If strong school media centers positively impact middle school student reading achievement, can the same be said for middle school science achievement?\r\n\r\nUsing a sequential explanatory mixed-methods process, the researcher undertook a study that built upon the statistical analyses used in the MSLS with qualitative measures in an attempt to discover intrinsic and extrinsic relationships between science education and school library media programs. Issues investigated included how the relationship between school library media programs and reading achievement was similar to the relationship between school library media programs and science achievement; the characteristics of school librarians and school library programs that influence the relationship science achievement; media specialists\' perceptions of the effects of yearly testing in science and other systemic pressures in their relationship with science educators and students; and the factors that school library media specialists identify as key to effective interactions with science teachers and students. Taking into account eligibility for the National School Lunch Program and district per-pupil expenditures, the researcher examined usage, staffing, collection, technology, and budgetary school library media program variables and found that 2002 eighth-grade MEAP science test scores had a significant positive relationship only with the size of the media center video collection.

Methodology included triangulation of data: observations, interviews, and analysis of documents from each site.\r\n\r\nMajor differences were found in the two programs. In the flexibly scheduled media center, students have more frequent access individually and in small groups. The media specialist participates more often in planning with teachers and as an instructional consultant. Some teachers schedule activities to a much greater extent than others. Teachers express a degree of fit between the media program\'s goals and the school\'s philosophy. Many teachers and students seem to be developing a sense of ownership of the media center. Teachers and their assistants frequently accompany their students for nonscheduled activities. Lack of clerical assistance is a significant barrier to greater program development.\r\n\r\nThe traditionally scheduled media center ensures regular access and the same instruction for all students. Although encouraged, nonscheduled student use is rare, except for groups in grades 3-5 for circulation. The media specialist integrates her activities using a timeline of teachers\' units, but planning with teachers is minimal. The full, fixed schedule and released time policy are barriers to program development.\r\n\r\nThe findings suggest several factors which may influence the choice of schedule and the instructional consultant role: (1) the educational philosophies of participants, (2) consideration of time, (3) commitment to the instructional consultant role, including personal qualities of the media specialist, (4) collaboration with teachers (planning styles, teaching styles, teaming, and collegiality), (5) roles of all participants, (6) diffusion of innovation, regarding flexible scheduling as an innovation, and (7) external factors such as released time policies, funding, staffing, school size, media center size and location, and technical and community support.

Rather it has been a story that has also included struggles and disappointments. Because, in Alberta, education, including school library programs, is the mandate of local jurisdictions, great inequity has resulted in the quality of resource collections, library facilities, technology, and professional and technical leadership and services to which students and teachers have access. There are several factors that have led to this disparity, including, until recent times, the lack of official provincial policy, standards, and program model.\r\n\r\nSchool library programs in a number of jurisdictions in Alberta are in a state of crisis. In some districts, teacher-librarians\' designated time in the library has been drastically reduced or teacher-librarians have been replaced by library technicians or library assistants; in other districts the position of teacher-librarian has never been there to cut or replace. These unfortunate situations have been made worse in recent years by a decrease in the financial support of education in general and the usurping of funds, once assigned to the purchasing of library resources and the hiring of library personnel, for the purchase of the new communications technology and the hiring of computer specialists. This situation is occurring even though there is more conclusive evidence than ever before to prove that the presence of quality school library programs staffed by professional teacher-librarians, do have a positive effect on student achievement.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this study was to trace the development of school library programs in Alberta and to identify the factors that have supported and limited program development. By so doing, it is intended that the study will provide direction for the development of school library programs of the future.\r\n\r\nA second purpose of this study was to create an historical record of school library development in Alberta. This was achieved through a review of archival records of the Department of Education, universities, school boards, community interest groups, the School Library Council, the Audio-Visual Council, the Learning Resources Council, and the Library Association of Alberta and through the recording and transcription of over eighty oral history tapes of interviews with school library pioneers throughout the province.\r\n\r\nThe development of the school library program, as with education in general, has reflected the diverse political, economic, religious, cultural, demographic, climatic, technological, and geographic conditions of the province. Many of these conditions have been recognized in the framework within which the story of the program\'s development was told. A belief in the importance of the school library program provided strong motivation for this study and it was hoped that an understanding of its past may be used to benefit the present and future students of the schools of Alberta.','Education history','School administration','Library science','0','NQ49539'),(540,'The Progress of Domestic Library Science Theory in 1998-2007 and Theoretical System Establishing in the 21st Century','DT',2008,'Zhou, Hui','M.A.','Hebei University','','','','','','','','','','','','','China','Hebei University','China','literature analysis','','','http://login.ezproxy.library.ualberta.ca/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1026673506?accountid=14474','The theoretical study is the foundation of a discipline.

As the passage of time introduced new technologies into the world of education, these standards were reviewed and revised. After each revision, the standards, which were later referred to as guidelines, reflected an updated view on the school librarian\'s position with additional responsibilities listed in the form of roles. Researchers have explored perceptions of educator groups regarding these roles, to determine if they were accepted by the members of the school community (Church, 2008; Dorrell & Lawson, 1995; Gustafson, 1982; Kaplan, 2006; McCracken, 2001; Mohajerin & Smith, 1981; Person, 1993; Roach, 1989; Schon, Helmstadter, & Robinson, 1991; Scott, 1986; Shannon, 1996; Shelton, 2002). Repeatedly, findings indicated disagreement among the educator groups and an overall lack of support of these roles from teachers, administrators, and even school librarians themselves, in some cases. If a lack of support for the fulfillment of these roles exists, the school library program cannot develop to its full potential. Consequently, the school librarian cannot fully contribute to student achievement, and a valuable resource is wasted. This study explored perceptions held by educators at the elementary level on the roles of the school librarian, in light of the latest revision to the guidelines (American Association of School Librarians, 2009) which added the role of leader to the list of expectations for school librarians, to determine if a lack of support for the fulfillment of these roles persists.','Library science','Educational leadership','School administration','0','3557505'),(542,'Exploring the information-seeking behavior of the staff and students of the Florida Virtual School: A case study','DT',2008,'Hart, Christopher Thomas','Ph.D.','The Florida State University','','','','','','','','','','','','','United States','The Florida State University','United States','case study','','','http://login.ezproxy.library.ualberta.ca/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/89274674?accountid=14474','Using a case study approach, this exploratory study investigated the manner in which the staff and students of the Florida Virtual School (FLVS) seek information resources and services and whether their information-seeking behavior could be explained by the application of the Bates berrypicking model. Influencing factors studied were integration of information literacy and selected demographics. The context of the case was presented through issues that affect information seeking in a virtual school such as legislative policy, budgetary policy, and accreditation issues. An examination of the literature showed that no previous published research had examined the information-seeking behavior of staff and students in a virtual secondary school setting.\r\n\r\nThe population included sixteen administrators, all twenty instructional designers, and all 308 full time teachers. In addition, thirty-six English II students in a class containing an open-ended research assignment, were included as part of the population of this study. The FLVS, recognized as a leader in K-12 virtual education and viewed as a critical case, was selected as the setting for this study.\r\n\r\nThe results of this study indicated that most course designers, teachers and students surveyed seek information using a berrypicking mode except in subject searching, while teachers in the math and critical research and thinking skills departments preferred a linear mode. This study also showed that FLVS director level administrators viewed their responsibility as important in assuring that teachers and students were able to seek out and use information resources and services. Content incorporated into FLVS courses by course designers was often obtained from Internet websites and FLVS purchased resources (i.e., BrainPOP, United Streaming, and SAS inSchool Curriculum Pathways). Likewise, FLVS teachers relied upon teacher- or department-developed knowledge bases, Internet websites, online databases and textbooks when seeking out information resources to supplement the existing centrally created course content. When completing an open-ended research assignment, FLVS students relied upon information resources provided by the FLVS and those available on the Internet even when they also attended a ‘brick-and-mortar’ school with a library. Both the influencing factors and contextual issues studied had an effect on the information-seeking behavior of the staff and students at the FLVS.\r\n\r\nOutcomes or impacts of this study include increased knowledge about information-seeking behavior, increased knowledge about the application of the berrypicking model, new knowledge about information-seeking behavior in the virtual school environment, further evidence-based information practices in virtual K-12 schools, and the identification of additional areas for further research about information-seeking behavior in other state sponsored virtual K-12 schools.','Library science','Educational software','Information systems','0','3321490'),(543,'Professional development of elementary library media specialist in Chicago public school from 1975–1998','DT',1999,'Waiters, Lois Kathleen','Ed.D.','Loyola University Chicago','','','','','','','','','','','','','United States','Loyola University Chicago','United States','-','','','http://login.ezproxy.library.ualberta.ca/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/304512310?accountid=14474','unknown','Adult education','Continuing education','Library science','0','387089'),(544,'Administrative Perceptions on the Role of the School Library Media Specialist','DT',2013,'Page, Kayla','Ed.D.','Walden University','','','','','','','','','','','','','United States','Walden University','United States','cross-sectional survey','chi-square test','','http://login.ezproxy.library.ualberta.ca/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1466301083?accountid=14474','Despite the efforts of local school library media specialists to promote their programming, many administrators do not understand the roles and responsibilities of the school library media specialist. Using a constructivist theoretical framework, this study was designed to examine the local school administrators\' perceptions of the role of the school library media specialist. The research design was a cross-sectional survey. A convenience sample of 82 local school administrators was asked to complete a Likert scale survey that addressed the services offered through the media center, the of those services, and the awareness of services offered that are relative to learning standards. Data were analyzed through a chi-square test to understand the administrative base knowledge for their perceptions or attitudes on the roles, responsibilities, and impact of the school library media center program. A significant difference was found between a knowledge base obtained from administrative training compared to a knowledge base that was gained through personal experiences. These findings suggest that school library media specialists need to provide administrators with more collegial reinforcement such as an instructional support plan that can inform administrators on the intervention resources that school library media specialists can implement. Implications for social change include enhanced educational relationships, improved communication and collaboration amongst educators, and an increased leadership presence within the school library media specialist community.\r\n\r\nDetails','Library science','Educational evaluation','School administration','0','3601152'),(545,'School Library Media Specialists\' Perceptions of Collaboration, Leadership and Technology','DT',2013,'Powell, Jozan M.','Ph.D.','University of South Florida','','','','','','','','','','','','','United States','University of South Florida','United States','Alternatively Certified (AC) and Traditionally Certified (TC) SLMS ','variance, standard deviation, t-tests, chi-square tests, and ANOVA','statistical analysis ','http://login.ezproxy.library.ualberta.ca/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1432190443?accountid=14474','School impact media studies indicate that a well-staffed and funded school library media program with a certified school library media specialist (SLMS) positively correlates with increased student achievement. SLMS must have a shared understanding of their roles and responsibilities to positively impact student success. In an effort to determine prior knowledge and differentiated learning objectives, the method of certification is critical for planning professional development. This dissertation presents a multi-method investigation of differences between Alternatively Certified (AC) and Traditionally Certified (TC) SLMS as it relates to their perceptions of collaboration, leadership and technology described in Information Power: Building Partnerships for Learning (1998). The overall findings were used to generate recommendations for SLMS professional development.\r\n\r\nOf 2350 total SLMS in Florida, 161 AC and 318 TC SLMS responded to an online job task analysis. The strength of association between method of certification and perceptions of job tasks under the three themes (collaboration, leadership, and technology) were compared using statistical analysis (i.e. variance, standard deviation, t-tests, chi-square tests, and ANOVA). Longitudinal comparisons were made between this study and baselines studies from 1996 and 2006. There were no significant differences between AC and TC overall perceptions of collaboration, leadership and technology as indicated by the job task analysis survey. Two tasks within collaboration and technology themes had large significant differences in AC and TC responses. TC SLMS were more likely to \"Assist students and/or teachers with general references services (e.g., answer reference questions)\" and to \"Evaluate the adequacy and suitability of facilities, equipment, materials, and services with regard to their impact on learning outcomes.\" TC SLMS were significantly more familiar with IP2, made more attempts to implement IP2, and attended more in-services on IP2.\r\n\r\nObservations and interviews with two AC and two TC SLMS triangulated the survey data and explored questions related to professional development. Interview participants advocated for content developed by other SLMS and mentorship training. SLMS asserted that professional development should include school and county protocols, evaluation tools and methods, relevant and accessible technologies (i.e. school and district software, Student Information System, Library Databases Standards such as CORE Curriculum). The SLMS indicated a preference for the following professional development methods: SLMS designed and implemented professional development; formal and informal SLMS sharing; differentiation and options to opt-out based on prior experiences and expertise; relevant and accessible technology training; and mentorship. These findings inform ways to effectively recruit, train, certify, and differentiate instruction in SLMS programs and professional development courses. Furthermore, our qualitative findings indicate a need to examine the impact of reduced budgets on school library media programs. Future studies should investigate the impact of increased numbers of non-certified SLMS and cuts to library staff on student achievement and K-12 learning communities. While this study counted the total number of non-certified SLMS in addition to the AC and TC SLMS, results from the sample of non-certified SLMS collected during the job task analysis were not analyzed because it was too small for comparison or generalizability.','Library science','Teacher education','Educational technology','0','3590453'),(546,'Web 2.0 definition, usage, and self -efficacy: A study of graduate library school students and academic librarians at colleges and universities with ALA accredited degree programs','DT',2009,'Davis, Clay','Ph.D.','The University of Alabama','','','','','','','','','','','','','United States','The University of Alabama','United States','survey','questionnaire','','http://login.ezproxy.library.ualberta.ca/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/304844103?accountid=14474','The topic of Web 2.0 has been studied several times within the field of library science, but there are several areas that warrant additional research: (a) examining definition of Web 2.0; and (b) providing baseline descriptive data for Web 2.0 usage; and (c) addressing psychometric concerns with measures of self-efficacy of Web 2.0; and (d) investigating the predictive quality of Web 2.0 self-efficacy towards Web 2.0 use within the aforementioned parameters for both Academic Library Association Accredited graduate library school students (students) and academic librarians (librarians) at institutions with Academic Library Association Accredited graduate library schools. These concerns formed the basis of this dissertation research.\r\n\r\nData were collected from two populations: ALA accredited graduate library school students at all the ALA accredited graduate library school students (N = 6232), and academic librarians from institutions with ALA accredited graduate library schools (N = 2601). This research resulted in the creation of a Web 2.0 definition instrument, a Web 2.0 usage instrument, and 7 Web 2.0 self-efficacy tool instruments. Each instrument extracts information about Web 2.0 as it pertains to library science. Since Web 2.0 is such a broad topic, seven of the Web 2.0 tools were chosen for concentration within this research. Overall results from definition indicate that the strongest agreement toward definition of Web 2.0 was the term \"information sharing\", whereas librarians felt that \"user-centered-web\" was a more suitable definition, and students felt that \"information sharing\" was a more suitable definition for Web 2.0. Overall Web 2.0 was being used among the library science population (at least 1 hour per week for social networking). With regard to self-efficacy toward Web 2.0, students mean self-efficacy items ranged from 2.35 (understanding of rss validation), to 4.49 (understanding why people use social networking sites), whereas librarians mean self-efficacy items ranged from 2.47 (ability to validate rss) to 4.35 (understanding of why people use wikis). Results showed that Web 2.0 self efficacy was not a predictor of Web 2.0 usage. Finally, this research provided baseline data for future research in Web 2.0 for library science. The results suggest that library science educators and library science practitioners may want to consider how Web 2.0 can be incorporated into library science.','Library science','Educational technology','Higher education','0','3358582'),(547,'Essays on the economics of education in developing countries','DT',2010,'Borkum, Evan','Ph.D.','Columbia University','','','','','','','','','','','','','United States','Columbia University','United States','Bayes\' rule','','','http://login.ezproxy.library.ualberta.ca/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/750004598?accountid=14474','This dissertation studies several dimensions of education policy that are particularly relevant to the educational systems of developing countries.

A number of factors were explored, including but not limited to reading frequency, library use frequency, and students’ socioeconomic status, in relation to students’ overall academic achievement. Factors related to reading habits and students’ reading environment were also explored, including the presence and type of printed materials in the home, whether students read to others, whether students can take books home, and student/librarian interactions. In terms of the library factor, the study was framed as a baseline study in that it provided a snapshot of the Kitengesa Library at a very early stage of the library’s development – a developmental stage that can be useful when exploring the impact of other more recent rural libraries. In the same way that a still photograph captures a moment in time that has since changed, the exploration of the archival data used for this study is key to understanding how a new village library may impact its users. The outcomes of the study suggest that the factors that were explored have varied levels of impact on students. Access to a library and frequency of library use are not predictive of students’ academic outcomes, but reading frequency and the reading of certain types of printed materials for recreational purposes are, and these factors are often contingent on the presence of a library. In Uganda, only 18 percent of girls and 20 percent of boys are enrolled in secondary school, and this group of students (ages 13-17) is particularly vulnerable to a wide range of social and economic challenges. Classrooms with few scholastic resources and teachers with little access to supplemental reading materials undermine student learning and academic success, which further impairs the long-term development of a reading culture. It is the intent of the researcher to use the outcomes of the study to provide a framework for exploring the factors that may impact academic achievement within the context of the rural village library in other rural settings. The findings will be used to highlight challenges associated with learning in rural environments such as the one being studied, and also highlight the potential of the rural village library in providing services and programs to support student learning.','Library science','Educational evaluation','Sub Saharan Africa Studies','0','3505908'),(549,'Becoming Researchers: Community College ESL Students, Information Literacy, and the Library','DT',2011,'Patterson, David Jay','Ph.D.','University of California, Berkeley','','','','','','','','','','','','','Bayes\' rule','University of California, Berkeley','Bayes\' rule','qualitative','case study','','http://login.ezproxy.library.ualberta.ca/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/928947886?accountid=14474','This qualitative case study explored the information literacy acquisition of 23 students enrolled in a learning community consisting of an advanced ESL writing class and a one unit class introducing students to research at a suburban community college library in California. As there are no other known learning communities that link an ESL course to a library course, this site afforded a unique opportunity to understand the ways in which ESL students learn to conduct library research. Students encountered difficulties while finding, evaluating, and using information for their ESL assignments. These problems were substantial, but more noteworthy were the strategies that the students, their ESL instructor and their instructional librarian crafted in response.\r\n\r\nThe learning community structure enabled a number of important strategies. Strategies by the instructors included integration of the two courses\' curricula; contextualized learning activities; cross-over teaching by the instructors; explicit instruction followed by guided workshop sessions. Some student strategies were persistence in asking questions, dictionary use, re-reading, and a resourceful disposition. Joint strategies included dialogue to clarify research strategies and to understand difficult text, student-crafted research techniques that were observed by instructors and shared with class; and an affirmation of the students\' emerging research practices.\r\n\r\nThis study adds to our understanding of one particular area of academic discourse acquisition in a second language—how ESL students learn to interact with information in the context of community college. This study\'s findings refute the idea that ESL students must wait to become researchers until their English is college-ready.

Three sub-questions that focused the study were: How do students experience literature-based reading instruction? How do students transact with young adult literature in a literature-based reading classroom? What is the role of the teacher librarian as readers\' advisor with students who participate in literature-based reading instruction?\r\n\r\nReading instruction was organized around Daniels\' (2002) model of literature circles, where novels were introduced and students formed reading and discussion groups based on their choice. Free choice reading time was a primary component of the curriculum. Readers\' advisory was conducted regularly with the students in the school library. The teacher-researcher\'s hybrid position (1/3 reading teacher and 2/3 teacher-librarian) allowed for insider access to investigate the questions.\r\n\r\nSix focal students that represented a range of attitudes toward reading (disliked, ambivalent, and enjoyed reading) were selected from a class of twenty-two. The students participated in interviews and panel discussions throughout the school year. The teacher researcher kept an audio journal throughout the school year and collected artifacts from the focal students. Data were analyzed by a combination of traditional qualitative methods and narrative inquiry and viewed through the theoretical lenses of reader response, literacy as a social practice, and learning as a social activity.\r\n\r\nThe researcher found that, above all, gender dynamics (in this case; traditional and hetero-normative) impact student and classroom interactions. Additionally, both students and the teacher take time to learn literature-based instruction processes. Group conflict will occur in literature circles and needs to be worked through as part of this learning process. Also, students respond more positively to culturally relevant literature and need to be matched with novels that meet their present reading level. The teacher-librarian needs to support students by recommending materials both inside and outside the traditional literary canon. Finally, a developed relationship between the student and the teacher-librarian leads to more meaningful readers\' advisory.\r\n\r\nFuture studies should investigate the nature of school library readers\' advisory transactions and how readers\' advisory can support literacy initiatives in schools.','Curricula','Teaching','Library science','0','3194907'),(551,'A study of library services provided to students in bilingual education programs by elementary school library media centers in South Texas','DT',1998,'Ayala-Schueneman, Maria de Jesus','Ed.D.','Texas A&M University - Kingsville','','','','','','','','','','','','','Bayes\' rule','Texas A&M University - Kingsville','Bayes\' rule','survey ','','','http://login.ezproxy.library.ualberta.ca/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/304483067?accountid=14474','The Bilingual Education Act of 1968 recognized the needs of limited English-speaking children and stipulated that financial assistance would be provided to local institutions to meet, develop, and carry out new and imaginative programs to meet the educational needs of these children. Thirty years after this initial goal it is questionable whether this mandate has yet been completely implemented.\r\n\r\nIn order to gain the necessary data concerning bilingual education and elementary school libraries in South Texas, a survey was sent to librarians/media specialists in Texas Education Agency Region I and II (roughly the lower Rio Grande Valley to Corpus Christi). The survey included items concerning the demographics of the school, book collection size, budget information, library programs and activities, collaboration between teachers and librarians, Spanish language abilities of library staff, and opinions and attitudes of librarians/media specialists toward bilingual education.\r\n\r\nThe data showed that Region I (which borders Mexico) is more populous in absolute terms and also has a greater proportion of bilingual/LEP students than Region II. In both regions the amount of Spanish language materials and programs lags behind the proportion of bilingual/LEP students in the general population. Besides problems with funding, the survey revealed problems with the number and quality of Spanish titles available, as well as a lack of cooperation between teachers and librarians. Most librarians/media specialists fully supported bilingual education, but a minority expressed doubts about the value of bilingual education. This attitude was mirrored by low percentages of Spanish language materials in may libraries.

This study examines the beliefs of education and policy leaders about the most important elements of successful university/education partnership in the context of one program, UDLib/SEARCH, in which the University of Delaware Library provides online full text periodical databases and training to all high schools and middle schools in the state of Delaware with state funds. The UDLib/SEARCH program was motivated by University administration\'s desire to provide a new tangible public service to schools statewide and to further strengthen the University/state relationship pertaining to education. University of Delaware President David Roselle called the UDLib/SEARCH project “one example of the power of partnership between the University and the state in serving the citizens of the state.” (University of Delaware, 1998, p. 1).\r\n\r\nThe qualitative research methodology utilized in this study involved interviews with education and policy leaders from schools, the state, and the University involved in or affected by UDLib/SEARCH. Interviewees included the University of Delaware President, Provost, Dean of the College of Human Resources, Education and Public Policy, and Director of Libraries; State Secretary of Education, State Budget Director, Education Policy Advisor to the Governor, State Director of Telecommunications, and the State Librarian; Superintendent of Schools, School Principal, and School Librarians from two Delaware schools. The main research questions focus on the beliefs of these leaders and include: What is the definition of partnership? What are the elements of successful university/education partnership? Is the state of Delaware different when it comes to partnerships? Is the UDLib/SEARCH program considered successful? What are examples of educational collaborations and partnerships these leaders consider successful? What are common elements of a successful university/state education partnership?\r\n\r\nThe subsequent analysis of the beliefs of education and policy leaders may assist in future development of collaborative activities between the University of Delaware and other education organizations, and also other university libraries who wish to collaborate with K–12 education.','School administration','Higher education','Secondary education','0','9927683'),(554,'The perceptions of the role of the library media program and the library media specialist in selected National Blue Ribbon Schools in Florida','DT',1999,'Mosqueda, Barbara Ray','','University of Central Florida','','','','','','','','','','','','','Bayes\' rule','University of Central Florida','Bayes\' rule','survey ','','','http://login.ezproxy.library.ualberta.ca/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/304568468?accountid=14474','The study investigated perceptions of principals and library media specialists of the role of library media programs and library media specialists as recommended by the American Association of School Librarians and the Association of Educational Communications and Technology in Information Power: Building Partners for Learning (1998).

Particular emphasis was placed on primary source materials retrieved from the Internet. Teachers were selected because they included an archival unit in the classroom curriculum.\r\n\r\nThree face-to-face interviews were conducted with each teacher. One interview was conducted with the media specialist who worked with each teacher. Each teacher provided artifacts used in the archival unit: instructional materials, student materials, and assessment tools. Data were analyzed using Tesch\'s eight-step organizational method to find categories and patterns associated with the classroom use of primary sources and in teacher collaboration with the media specialist.\r\n\r\nAfter data analysis, themes emerged in four categories: teaching practices, student outcomes, primary source use, and media center relationships. In teaching practices, the teachers: were passionate about history and about making it real; viewed history as a way for students to connect to the past and become good decision-makers; were inhibited by the structured curriculum; were varied in teaching styles but designed methods to meet individual student needs; and tailored research methods and student assessments to their projects and their student population.\r\n\r\nStudent goals and expectations matched those of the National History Standards though the teachers did not consciously use the standards.

If they are to continue to improve in their role as information centers of their parent institutions and attempt to serve as links to external sources and environments, the future of these libraries must not be obscured by traditional planning strategies in the areas of program development, budgeting, staffing, and resource development.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this study was to investigate how certain planning strategies affected the library administrators\' ability to obtain support for library programs and development at historically Black colleges and universities over a ten-year period from 1982 to 1992. Usable responses were received from 89 respondents out of the 103 institutions surveyed. A response rate of 64 per cent was achieved from the mailed questionnaire which was developed, pretested, and validated by the researcher.\r\n\r\nThe descriptive survey method using mailed questionnaires which contained both Likert-type scale queries and open-ended queries was selected as the most appropriate approach in gathering data. The 103 institutions surveyed included 66 public and 37 private two-year and four-year historically Black colleges and universities. Background descriptive data on the status of the institution were collected. Five hypothesis were tested using Chi-square analysis.\r\n\r\nThe research findings indicated that no relationship existed in Chi-square analysis between the superiority of any planning strategy in general, whether Management By Objectives, Long-Range Planning, or Strategic Planning, and the ability of the academic library administrator to obtain support for library programs at the historically Black college or university during the period 1982 to 1992.\r\n\r\nAlthough results in this study did not reveal a significant difference in the level of effectiveness of any one planning strategy, it was apparent that planning strategies led to successful results.','Library science','School administration','Higher education','0','9905348'),(559,'Changes in stated job requirements of director positions of academic libraries in the United States: A content analysis of qualifications and job expectations as advertised in selected professional periodicals','DT',2000,'Lin, Chih-feng P.','D.A.','','','','','','','','','','','','','','United States','Simmons College','United States','content analysis','','','http://login.ezproxy.library.ualberta.ca/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/304659000?accountid=14474','Over the past decades, society, economics, politics and technology have had a profound effect on the structure of the academic library. As a result of these changes in the library\'s structure, the role of the academic library director has changes, but to what extent? One place to look for answers to this question is employment ads. Due to spatial limitations, employment ads list criteria that institutions regard as most important for a library director to possess. This study examines the qualifications and expectations listed in employment ads in 1992 and in 1997 to determine whether any changes have occurred with the role of academic library directors. The study uses content analysis to determine categories for analysis and SPSS for the statistical analysis. The changes from 1992 to 1992 in qualifications show that directors must have an advanced degree in library science as well as another field and fewer years of overall experience. More institutions also require directors to have skills that are not only beneficial for traditional library operations, but also for external purposes. Furthermore, fundraising experience becomes and added asset. With the job expectations, academic library directors are expected to have an increased layer in their report line, have balanced knowledge of technology and general library functions, and increase fundraising activities. Directors should also maintain an excellent overall portrait. These changes support the notion of the library\'s becoming more influenced by external sources, the flattening of the hierarchy with the library management, and the need for a scholarly director. The study also gives suggestions for improvements in the LIS curriculum that will better prepare individuals for careers as academic library directors in these changing times.','Library science','Higher education','School administration','0','9969425'),(560,'Addressing the needs of students with color vision deficiencies in the elementary school library','DT',2013,'Collins, Karla Bame','Ph.D.','Old Dominion University','','','','','','','','','','','','','United States','Old Dominion University','United States','interviews','questionnaire ','observations','http://login.ezproxy.library.ualberta.ca/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1450241066?accountid=14474','Color vision deficiencies affect approximately eight percent of the male population (Birch & Chisholm, 2008; Cole, 2007; Jenny & Kelso, 2007; Neitz & Neitz, 2000), yet the condition is often overlooked in the educational setting despite the pervasiveness of color in the school (Suero et al., 2004). The purpose of this study was to explore how elementary school librarians provide instruction and prepare the library environment to meet the needs of students with color vision deficiencies.\r\n\r\nThis mixed methods study consisted of two components. The first component was a questionnaire administered to elementary school librarians throughout Virginia to gather data related to their knowledge of and attitudes toward students with color vision deficiencies. The second component of the study was a case study of eight elementary school librarians in one school division within Virginia. The case study participants were given the same questionnaire as the state group to assess their knowledge of and attitudes toward students with color vision deficiencies. Then they participated in observations, interviews, and a color vision deficiencies awareness training designed to inform school librarians about issues related to color vision deficiencies. The training was followed by a series of journal prompts through a blog and additional observations to gather information about changes in behaviors. After the training, a post-test was administered to the case study participants to gather data about changes in knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors.\r\n\r\nFindings indicate that elementary school librarians did not feel knowledgeable about color vision deficiencies but were interested in knowing more and expressed a desire to make changes based on participating in the questionnaire alone. The case study participants\' increase in knowledge from pretest to post-test was statistically significant. While the change in attitude on the questionnaire was not found to be statistically significant for the case study group, there were noticeable changes in beliefs and desires to change behaviors as evidenced through the qualitative data. The changes in the case study lend support to the need for color vision deficiency awareness training for elementary school educators.','Educational tests & measurements','Library science','Educational evaluation','0','3574569'),(561,'An Examination of the Leadership Program for College Library Directors Associated with ACRL\'s College Libraries Section','DT',2012,'Herold, Irene M.

In response to a 1989 conference panel of directors’ recommendation that there be program for developing college librarians as leaders for the next century, CLS sponsored activities to encourage leadership development, particularly in college library directors; such development was defined in terms of the creation of a leadership committee which had the charge of encouraging improvement of leadership among college librarianship. The result was the ongoing yearlong mentoring program, the College Library Director Mentor Program (CLDMP).\r\n\r\nThis dissertation reviews the history of CLS from 1940 through 2009. No previous study had looked at the evolving activities of CLS for the development of leadership, management, or both, or probed whether or not the directors participating in CLS activities have increased their knowledge, skills, and abilities about management and leadership or how they applied those attributes to their role as college library directors. Using narrative inquiry to construct a history of the management and leadership activities of CLS and the CLDMP resulted in placing the association members, new college library directors, their actions, and the ensuing activities in the temporal and contextual continuum in which they occurred. The historical records of CLS, interviews with three past CLS leaders, and content analysis of reports and curriculum from the CLDMP identified the critical, like, and other events of CLS’ professional development activities. Despite activities originating from the goal of developing leadership, the CLS Leadership Committee’s work, programs, discussion groups, and the CLDMP did not develop leadership, but were managerially-oriented.\r\n\r\nThis study represents the first phase of the CLDMP from its inception in 1992 through 2009. After 17 years, the founding CLDMP program directors announced they are retiring. Therefore, it appears to be an opportune time to consider changes based upon the findings of this research. Applicable leadership theories, suggested by the narrative and report analysis, such as transformational leadership, emotional intelligence, and resonant leadership could strengthen the CLDMP curriculum to provide leadership development content. The CLDMP curriculum had general management goals, but no learning outcomes for the program. Several optional, outcome-based curriculum models for leadership development, such as one based on a leadership workbook approach, another on reframing approaches, and the Managerial Leadership in the Information Professions model, were described for CLDMP consideration.','Library science','Management','School administration','0','3515783'),(562,'The impending leadership crisis in Historically Black College and University (HBCU) libraries: A mixed methods study','DT',2009,'Youmans, Tasha Lucas','Ph.D.','Capella University','','','','','','','','','','','','','United States','Capella University','United States',' demographic information collection','','','http://login.ezproxy.library.ualberta.ca/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/305160748?accountid=14474','The purpose of this study was to disclose the claims of an impending shortage of librarians in academic libraries as it relates to Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs).

This study analyzed quantitative data collected from the Minnesota Comprehensive Assessments (MCA), which recorded public school reading achievement levels. A follow-up portion of the study consisted of interviews with six administrators at schools that were one or more standard deviations above and below the failing mean to explain how they compensated for the loss of the certified library media specialist (CLMS).\r\n\r\nFor the purposes of this study, student reading failure rate was defined as the sum of the percentages of students with gaps in knowledge and partial knowledge and skills on the MCA reading exams. The interpretation of the quantitative data suggested that student reading scores did not decline with the removal of the CLMS.\r\n\r\nInterviews with school administrators identified factors that may contribute to the improvement in student reading achievement. These factors included continuous access to the media center and materials, staffing levels to provide service for students and staff, improved reading programs, and commitment by faculty and staff to ensure students a quality education.\r\n\r\nThis study only looked at one small segment of an elementary student\'s education, reading test scores. A CLMS has a greater impact on an elementary school than just the reading area, as revealed the Library Impact Studies. These studies indicated that the CLMS performs a multitude of duties, including: collaborating with teachers; providing leadership and expertise in the acquisition and evaluation of information resources; teaching information literacy skills; and establishing policies and procedures of the library media programs.

A small (student population of approximately 1,000) rural high school, a suburban school with a student population of approximately 2,000, and a large (student population over 3,000) urban school were selected for the study, and agreed to participate. Interviews or observations were conducted with the building principal or assistant principal for curriculum, the school library media specialist, and six vocational education teachers in each school. Teachers were asked to identify the information resources available to them in their classrooms or in the school, and to specify those resources that they used personally, those that they used in their classrooms or the school library media center, and those to which they referred students. Teachers were also asked about the degree to which they collaborated with the library media specialist to incorporate information resources and information literacy skills into classroom work.\r\n\r\nThe interviews and observations revealed the wide availability of, and a growing reliance upon computer and telecommunication technology to provide access to current information for vocational education, career, and skills teachers. Vocational education teachers and high school library media specialists in this study plan together for the purchase of new material and resources, but spend little time planning to incorporate information literacy skills or the use of information resources into course content. Most teachers interviewed were not familiar with SUNLINK, with the school\'s OPAC, or with school purchased electronic periodical databases. Key elements effecting access and use of information appeared, in the schools studied, to be the proximity of the information resource tool to the teacher, teacher comprehension of the applicability and use of the information contained in the resource tool, and the value the teacher placed on the information and the resource tool.','Library science','Inservice training','Secondary education','0','9977891'),(566,'Perceptions, beliefs, and expectations of preservice and experienced middle school teachers regarding the roles of school library media specialists','DT',2000,'Hayden, Janis Theresa Wool','Ph.D.','Georgia State University','','','','','','','','','','','','','United States','Georgia State University','United States','qualitative ','interviews ','','http://login.ezproxy.library.ualberta.ca/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/304589142?accountid=14474','The purpose of this qualitative study was to examine the roles experienced and preservice middle school teachers believe school library media specialists should perform. Understanding how the perceptions developed and what or who influenced the beliefs was an important part of this inquiry. This study questioned whether teachers, both experienced and preservice, understand the roles.\r\n\r\nThe guiding questions were: (1) What tasks do experienced and preservice middle school teachers believe school library media specialists should perform? (2) How do the participants think their perceptions, beliefs, and expectations evolved? (3) What variables impact these perceptions, beliefs, and expectations?\r\n\r\nThe design and focus of this qualitative study was to complete a minimum of three in-depth interviews with three experienced and three preservice middle school teachers regarding their perceptions, beliefs, and expectations regarding the roles of the school library media specialist. All interviews were tape recorded, transcribed, and member checks performed. Field notes were taken during and after the interviews.\r\n\r\nThe participants had varied perceptions, beliefs, and expectations. However, all of the participants agreed that school library media specialists should teach computer skills to both students and teachers, and assist students and teachers in locating resources. They also mentioned information access and the purchasing of materials. Additionally, school library media specialists that they have worked with as students or teachers have had an impact on the views of the participants.\r\n\r\nIt is concluded from these results that these participants have varied perceptions of the roles. It would be difficult if not impossible for a school library media specialist to perform all of the tasks identified by these participants. Since school library media specialists have an impact on the perceptions of teachers, they should be aware of these implications and make every effort to be a positive role model and a leader in their schools and community. They should have a positive attitude and be helpful to students and teachers.

Nevertheless, it is necessary to point out certain peculiarities, as the interest of the Diputación to support economically the library until making it depend on their administrative structure, the interest of the local knowledge agglutinated around the Commission of Monuments by the bibliographical wealth of Navarra and a certain rejection to the cultural centralism that took to the Statutory Delegation to name the librarian.','Library science','Secondary education','School administration','0','9999731'),(568,'The role of the school library media specialist in the integration of computer technology in the high school curriculum','DT',2003,'Oliver, Sheila Quinn','Ed.D.','University of South Carolina','','','','','','','','','','','','','United States','University of South Carolina','United States','qualitative ','interviews','','http://login.ezproxy.library.ualberta.ca/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/305314563?accountid=14474','This qualitative inquiry determined how school library media specialists assist teachers in the integration of computer technology into the curriculum, how school library media specialists and classroom teachers collaborate to bring technology-based practices into the classroom, what challenges school library media specialists face in assisting teachers in the integration of computer resources, and if teachers considered media specialists to be leaders in the realm of computer technology.\r\n\r\nThe study revealed that school library media specialists were assisting teachers in the integration of computer technology in by telling them about the availability of resources to use in the curriculum. The media specialists reported they make teachers aware of resources available on the Internet and tell them about applications to publish and present student work. Some media specialists reported they teach teachers how to use software to create products. Media specialists reported they approach teachers with ideas to use computer technology in the classroom, media specialists were considered experts in the utilization of computer technology, and most teachers acknowledged that they look to the media specialist for ideas to use computer technology.\r\n\r\nEvidence of collaborative planning was sporadic, and several teachers said planning involved scheduling time to use media center resources. The common theme that prevailed throughout the interviews was that the school library media specialist was one who made the first move in integrating computer technology into the classrooms. The school library media specialist was the professional who approached teachers with ideas and plans on how to integrate computer technology in the classroom. The majority of the teachers in the sample considered their library media specialist a leader in the realm of computer technology because they believed the school library media specialist was more knowledgeable about how to use equipment than they.

At the conclusion of the workshop, school librarians were given the opportunity to participate in an eight-week online follow-up course that supported implementation of in-service themes.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this study was to examine the effects of online follow-up and collaboration on participant attitudes, quality of course product, and course completion in an online professional development course for librarians in 12 Texas school districts. This study used a posttest-only control group experimental design with self-selected participants. School librarians were stratified by level of service and socioeconomic school status and were randomly assigned to one of three environments. Two experimental environments were used: (a) Collaborative Follow-up and (b) Noncollaborative Follow-up and a control environment, Noncollaborative/No Follow-up. The experimental environments were given additional information and support in an online course to aid the creation of their TAKS Support Plan.\r\n\r\nResults indicate that the professional development program that included online collaboration and follow-up produced more positive attitudes towards the professional development program than the professional development program with no collaboration or follow-up. Attitudes towards the online professional development experience from the two experimental environments were mildly positive with no significant difference across groups. Attitudes towards the professional development experience in the control environment were significantly less positive than the experimental environments.

A review of the literature makes it clear that the issue of using filters in school libraries is a critical and controversial dilemma in today\'s digital environment.\r\n\r\nUsing qualitative research methods with a grounded theory approach, the findings in this study indicate that filters used in high school media centers block legitimate, constitutionally-protected speech. Students experience both underblocking and overblocking. Although the school district had established a policy for users to request that a site be unblocked, it was not effective. Students in the study were adept at getting around the filter, using a variety of approaches. Students said they were frustrated, annoyed and angry when they were blocked by the filter. The majority of students felt that the school\'s filter hindered their work in doing Internet research for their papers. The students had many practical ideas on alternate solutions to filtering, although they had never been asked. Students did not feel they were permanently harmed when they came upon an occasional inappropriate Web site. There was a significant disconnect between the district\'s technology administrators and the classroom, which resulted in an undercurrent of frustration and hopelessness at effecting change. Although there was no evidence of a digital divide in this study setting, the students recognized how they would be disadvantaged if they were not able to go home and use their own unfiltered computers.\r\n\r\nEven at the risk of losing federal funds, school districts should carefully consider whether filtering is necessary—or necessary at all grade levels. If the decision is made to filter, communication among students, teachers, librarians, and technology administrators is critically important to minimize the negative effects of filtering. Because the constitutional rights of students are at stake, districts need to exercise extreme caution that there is no filtering based on viewpoint. In districts where a digital divide exists, school leaders need to recognize the place of the library in ensuring equal access to information.','Library science','School administration','Educational software','0','3166752'),(573,'The information worlds of school librarians as digital learning leaders','DT',2016,'Luetkemeyer, Jennifer R.','Ph.D.','The Florida State University','','','','','','','','','','','','','United States','The Florida State University','United States','survey ','interviews','','http://login.ezproxy.library.ualberta.ca/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1844178264?accountid=14474','K-12 schools are making the move to digital learning resources, and are increasingly integrating technology into the curriculum. With training as both a teacher and an information specialist, the school librarian is in a position to help facilitate this transition to digital. The purpose of this research was to examine the extent to which school librarians perceive that they are prepared to act in the role of facilitator, and to determine what factors contribute to those perceptions. The study was guided by three research questions which explored school librarians’ self-perceptions of their technology leadership abilities, and how their school cultures and information worlds affect those perceptions.\r\n\r\nIn this case study, I used both quantitative and qualitative methods: a survey and follow-up interviews. The participants in this research were all Florida K-12 school librarians. In my analysis, I found that school librarians are largely prepared to act as technology leaders, but that there are many barriers to the enactment of that responsibility, many of which are related to a misunderstanding of the school librarian’s role in the school.\r\n\r\nThis is an exploratory project. Thus, additional research is needed into the factors that affect school librarian’s technology leadership skills enactment. Specifically, research is needed at the national level to determine whether or not the results of this study translate to the larger population of school librarians. Research is also needed into how the school librarian’s role can best be communicated to other school stakeholders. Further, while this research begins to explore the information worlds of school librarians, more extensive studies are needed in order to continue to piece together the many facets of those information worlds.','Library science','Educational technology','','0','10161151'),(574,'How school library media specialists support reading and information literacy skills instruction for English language learners','DT',2013,'Morin, Melinda','Ph.D.','Georgia State University','','','','','','','','','','','','','United States','Georgia State University','United States',' inductive thematic analysis','','','http://login.ezproxy.library.ualberta.ca/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1609014034?accountid=14474','This study explored the school library media programs in four schools.

The participants were the school library media specialists who administered the school library media programs in these schools. This was a qualitative study. During an inductive thematic analysis, the data coalesced into four themes that corresponded with the research questions: instruction, collaboration, media/technology, and interpersonal communication. These findings were derived from the data. 1. The participants used both conventional and technology-based instructional strategies to support reading and information literacy skills instruction for all of their students, including the ELLs. 2. The school library media collections included first language, bilingual, and multicultural literatures, picture books, nonfiction books written on a lower reading level, graphic materials, Hi-Lo reading materials and other digital resources; however, the materials varied in age, suitability, and condition. 3. The school library media specialists collaborated informally with the other members of the instructional team. 4.

These Guidelines serve as a standard for library media centers and programs throughout the nation. The recommendations found in the Guidelines are based on the analysis of data obtained from the study conducted by the Center for Education Statistics of the U.S. Department of Education, entitled: Statistics of Public and Private School Library Media Centers, 1985-86.\r\n\r\nResults of the data obtained from surveys sent to library media personnel throughout the state were analyzed in the same manner as the data in the Guidelines. The results indicated about the same percent of library media centers in Nebraska are providing high levels of service to students and staff as are libraries nationwide. The majority of the schools in the state which are low service schools, however, are elementary schools. These centers spend less of their budgets on books, subscriptions and audiovisual materials, while a greater proportion of their expenditures go to computers and computer related materials relative to high service schools. These low service schools also frequently have inadequate numbers of personnel serving students and staff. All the returned surveys indicated insufficient use of technology, except for computers, in library media centers.\r\n\r\nThe effects of Federal legislation on library media centers was also explored--particularly changes made in the early 1980s. These changes provided for the disbursement of Federal Funds based on applications from individual school districts, rather than the previous system of earmarking funds for specific programs. School districts frequently apply for and utilize funds specifically to upgrade computer hardware and software, thus excluding library media centers from receiving the benefit of much needed additional funds.','Curricula','Teaching','Library science','0','9219371'),(576,'Design preferences of media specialists for elementary school media centers in the state of Georgia','DT',2002,'Hlavaty, Kathleen Smith','Ed.D','University of Georgia','','','','','','','','','','','','','United States','University of Georgia','United States','survey ','','','http://login.ezproxy.library.ualberta.ca/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/305592813?accountid=14474','The elementary media center can be a vital part of an elementary school instructional program and play a large part in the functionality and the effectiveness of the school. This study examined key design elements of an elementary media center in order to determine a design preference for each element. The elements selected were determined through a review of related literature. Eight categories were addressed in the survey of Georgia elementary school media specialists. The categories included lighting/windows, color, flooring, HVAC, space, furnishings, technological support, and miscellaneous items. This information was then incorporated in a survey of current Georgia elementary school media specialists. The survey was completed by 75 media specialists attending the Georgia Conference of Media Organizations in 2001. A frequency analysis was completed on each item and the responses ranked from absolutely vital to not desirable. Elements that were perceived as important or absolutely vital to the design of an elementary media center were windows, natural lighting, well located light switches, upholstery colors that disguise heavy use, carpeting, low humidity level, a separate air conditioning system, separate areas designated by usage, ample power outlets, and workstations with power/data ports. Items perceived as not important included floor coverings other than carpet, windows that reach to the floor, brightly colored accent walls, and computer labs located within media centers. Specific information regarding shelving, tables, chairs, and an ideal layout was included in the study. Based upon the results of the analysis, recommendations were presented for enhancing the current method of planning and developing elementary school media centers in the state of Georgia. It was recommended that the state of Georgia rewrite the current facility guidelines, that the professional judgment of elementary media specialists\' preferences be considered when establishing guidelines, that community-based school media centers be studied for their specific design needs, and that a similar study be conducted concentrating on the middle school and high school level.','Elementary education','Library science','','0','804245'),(577,'Developing middle school readers.

Additionally, this study was designed to describe relationships between specific reading activities and positive student attitudes about reading. The study also examined the relationship between specific reading activities and students\' scores of 2100 of better on the Texas Assessment of Knowledge and Skills (TAKS) in reading. Finally, this study investigated the role of attitude toward reading using the Estes Scale to measure attitudes toward reading.\r\n\r\nThe data analyzed for this study was previously collected from the school district records and/or collected from the elementary schools by way of a survey and from the middle school students by way of the Estes Scale questionnaire.\r\n\r\nThe present findings indicate that both the low scoring students and the high scoring students had exposure to some of the same reading programs. The data also suggests that both low scoring students and high scoring students might have positive attitudes about reading. The results of this study support several assumptions: the reading programs and reading activities that students are exposed to in elementary school may not correlate with high scores on a standardized test; high scores on a standardized test may not correlate positively with a positive attitude about reading, although the reading programs and reading activities may play a small role in that development; positive attitudes about reading are not only evident in students who score 2400 or above on the TAKS Reading Assessment since some students who did not meet the TAKS standard also had positive attitudes about reading. Overall, these results suggest that there is no specific program that will guarantee high scores on the TAKS Reading Assessment. Instead, schools should look for a combination of programs and activities, from reading challenges to book parades to book giveaways, all targeting reading as a pleasurable activity.','Library science','Literacy','Reading instruction','0','3274165'),(578,'Strategic financial planning for research libraries: Alternative financial scenarios for Harvard College Library beyond the year 2000','DT',1995,'Cooper, John Martin','Ed.D.','Harvard University','','','','','','','','','','','','','United States','Harvard University','United States','computer based financial modeling','environmental analysis','multiple scenario analysis','http://login.ezproxy.library.ualberta.ca/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/304177596?accountid=14474','These are uncertain times for research libraries. The future juxtaposes optimism and harsh reality. The whole information structure that has been in place since the invention of the printing press is changing. This research addresses a most difficult financial dilemma facing research libraries and universities; how to afford maintaining the best of the traditional library while also incorporating new information technologies. The financial requirements for research libraries to survive and maintain traditional services are substantial, but when added to resources required to convert to a new age of information access, the financial challenges are staggering.\r\n\r\nHarvard College Library is selected for study because of its size, complexity and importance of maintaining traditional services, meaning comprehensive collection development, while guiding the introduction of new technology and services. Research questions are (1) What is the nature of forces that will influence the economics of Harvard College Library (HCL) in the next decade? (2) What are the critical variables affecting major income and expense components of HCL\'s budget? (3) What are the important budgetary tradeoffs that HCL will likely face in maintaining long-term financial well-being? The research approach analyzes strategic financial issues by utilizing computer based financial modeling, environmental analysis, and multiple scenario analysis.\r\n\r\nFinancial projections are developed for three scenarios. The first scenario is described as \"Holding the Course.\" It reflects a future where the library remains focused on strengthening a print oriented collection, while trying to respond, in an affordable and feasible manner, to demands for new investments in network and technology based information services. The second scenario, \"Through the Electronic Gateway, incorporates the powerful possibilities of rapid technological evolution in expanding services to scholars. It describes a shift in focus from collection development to accessing information in various formats. The third scenario, \"Economic Malaise\", is more pessimistic than the first two, and characterizes the next decade as a period of financial distress for universities and research libraries.\r\n\r\nComparing outcomes of financial simulations for the three scenarios demonstrates the need for new approaches to budgeting and financial planning for research libraries.','Higher education','School finance','School administration','0','9534599'),(579,'The relationship between school library media programs and student achievement on standardized reading tests in Utah','C',2003,'Eye, John Gregory','Ed.D.','University of South Dakota','','','','','','','','','','','','','United States','University of South Dakota','United States','Survey ','quantitative','','http://login.ezproxy.library.ualberta.ca/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/305314733?accountid=14474','The purpose of this study was to identify specific associations between selected variables of Utah school library media programs and student standardized reading scores, while controlling for free and reduced school lunch participation rates.

Today, the public and politicians tend to rely upon standardized testing as the most dependable measure of teaching and learning. Information Power: Building Partnerships for Learning, the guidelines for school library media programs, characterizes student achievement differently from the legislators\' more narrow view of standardized testing. The foundation for student achievement with Information Power is the information Literacy Standards for Student Learning and indicators that describe core learning outcomes. This study used the legislators\' definition of achievement.\r\n\r\nInformation Power states that a school library media center program based on collaboration, leadership, and technology provides strategies for improving student performance. Collaboration is defined as a partnership that requires a commitment to shared goals and the mission of the school. A shared sense of responsibility for improving instruction should result in better outcomes for all students.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this study was to examine the effect of collaboration among elementary school library media specialists, teachers, and principals on student achievement in 40 Georgia elementary schools, including four Library Power schools. The study sought to determine if the use of collaboration affects student achievement as indicated by the Reading Comprehension scores on Iowa Test of Basic Skills test for 3rd and 5th grades for the years 1994–1999. Forty principals and forty media specialists were surveyed to determine the existence of collaboration in their schools. These data were compared with student ITBS test data to determine if there might be an association between collaboration and student achievement, defined by legislators as standardized testing.\r\n\r\nAlthough this study failed to support any effect of the relationship between collaboration and student achievement in Georgia elementary schools, the most significant finding was the pattern revealing that the higher the percentage of free and reduced priced lunches, the lower the scores on the Iowa Test of Basic Skills in Reading Comprehension.','Library science','Elementary education','','0','3004420'),(581,'Identifying the information seeking behaviors of students, the expectations of faculty, and the role of librarians in writing assignments that require students to use information sources in selected Pennsylvania community colleges: A model for instruction','DT',2008,'Zaborowski, Barbara A.','Ph.D.','University of Pittsburgh','','','','','','','','','','','','','United States','University of Pittsburgh','United States','survey','','','http://login.ezproxy.library.ualberta.ca/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/219938073?accountid=14474','The intent of this exploratory study is to identify the information-seeking behaviors used by community college students when using information resources to complete a writing assignment, the expectations that faculty have in regard to that writing assignment and the role librarians can play in that process through information literacy instruction.

Promotional opportunities and increased salaries generally surface as major determinants of job satisfaction, but the burgeoning technology of information systems crowds them for status. New challenges for both manager and worker result in considerable implications for job satisfaction.\r\n\r\nThe university library, in its role as the center of information services on campuses, represents one work setting particularly affected by the rapid pace of technological changes. The library employee must cope with daily changes in information technology innovations. Do these changes in the work place affect job satisfaction for academic library professionals? Since people resist change, do technological changes in the academic library professional\'s job brought about by necessary automation cause a significant increase or decrease in job satisfaction? A stratified random sample from library professionals employed at 36 of the 70 Level I Carnegie Research Universities allowed using the Minnesota Satisfaction Questionnaire (MSQ) to examine technological innovation and job satisfaction. Combined with demographic questions, the result formed a depiction of the job satisfaction status for library professionals in these research institutions.\r\n\r\nThe results of this study revealed that almost 60% felt adequately prepared after receiving the electronic resources training available at their institutions. The remaining professionals did not feel prepared even though they received more training and spent more hours training others. This remaining 40% primarily stems from technical services and public services library professionals.

Favorable perceptions by upper level administrators of library directors and staff, and the library program of service, were positive impactors. No clear determination of the relationship between external funding and library allocation could be determined from the available evidence, except for the negative perceptions of upper level administrators regarding external general funding activity in relation to specific library needs. The findings supported a positive relationship between library standards and /or accreditation reviews by regional and national agencies and library allocation. No direct relationship between library allocation and faculty concerns about library resource could be documented from the available data. A positive relationship between library allocation and competition for resources by other campus support units was supported.','Higher education','School finance','School administration','0','9630145'),(594,'The roles of Birmingham City Schools\' media specialists: Principals\' and media specialists\' perceptions','DT',1992,'Glaze, James Randy','Ph.D.','The University of Alabama at Birmingham','','','','','','','','','','','','','United States','The University of Alabama at Birmingham','United States','self-report','mail survey','Media Specialists Role Assessment Survey','http://login.ezproxy.library.ualberta.ca/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/303991662?accountid=14474','The purpose of the study was to assess perceptions of principals and media specialists in the Birmingham Public Schools regarding the roles of the media specialist. Beliefs regarding the implementation of the role categories were analyzed and agreement between the responses of both groups were examined.\r\n\r\nThe study used a self-report, data-gathering technique: mail survey. The instrument, Media Specialists Role Assessment Survey (MSRAS), consisted of statements regarding the role of the media specialist that were gleaned from the literature and from the opinions of a panel of principals and media specialists from other districts. Seventy-five principals and 71 media specialists responded to the survey. The two groups represented 96% and 91%, respectively, of the total number of principals and media specialists in the school district.\r\n\r\nThe t-test was used used to inspect the differences between the perceptions of the media specialists and principals as related to the roles of the media specialists. There was no statistically significant difference found between the principals\' and media specialists\' beliefs concerning the role categories of Administration/Coordination, Assistance to Instructional Staff, Facilities and Equipment, and Public Relations. Significant differences at the 0.05 level between the ratings of media specialists and principals were observed in the categories of Assistance to Students and Instructional Materials.\r\n\r\nBased on the findings and conclusions of the study and available research, recommendations for practice were made for principals, media specialists, teachers, and institutions of higher education.

The study measured the directors\' perceptions of their libraries\' programs and activities identified as staff, collection development, and services against three priority criteria: centrality, demand and cost. It also sought to determine if the directors\' projections of library funding had any influence on their perceptions of future library priorities.\r\n\r\nA descriptive survey research method was adopted using a questionnaire as the research instrument. The population surveyed was the library directors in the twenty four Nigerian university libraries. The respondents evaluated twenty library programs and activities. Appropriate statistical analyses were performed using frequency, percentage and other measures of central tendency. Rank ordering of the means and standard deviations were used to compare the relationship among the programs and activities.\r\n\r\nThe results showed that many library programs and activities were considered more central to the missions and objectives of the libraries and the universities than the demand for them. Readers\' services and technical services were the most central activities. Books and periodicals were the programs most in demand. The most costly program in most of the surveyed libraries was books.\r\n\r\nLibrary services were of the most concern to the library directors, followed by collection development; of the least concern were staff and related issues. There was no significant difference between the future priorities of those directors anticipating increases and those anticipating decreases. However, library services and collection development will likely be given priority in the future with the most emphasis on the acquisition of periodicals.','School administration','Library science','','0','8810097'),(598,'THE ROLE OF THE HIGH SCHOOL LIBRARY MEDIA SPECIALIST AS PERCEIVED BY HIGH SCHOOL LIBRARY MEDIA SPECIALISTS, PRINCIPALS, AND TEACHERS IN THE STATE OF OREGON','DT',1984,'GAST, NANCY ELLEN','Ed.D.','Portland State University','','','','','','','','','','','','','United States','Portland State University','United States','questionnaire ','','','http://login.ezproxy.library.ualberta.ca/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/303314370?accountid=14474','Purpose. This role study was designed to examine the expectations held for the high school library media specialist by teachers, principals, and certificated school library media specialists in Oregon.\r\n\r\nSecondary purposes were: (1) to investigate library media specialists\' perceptions of the views of teachers and principals, (2) to compare the library media specialists\' perceptions of the actual views of teachers and principals, (3) to update information gathered from Oregon high schools by Anderson (1970), (4) to gather date on the use of selected instructional technology (computers and videotape), and (5) to determine what forms of evaluative instruments are in current use for the school library media specialist\'s role.\r\n\r\nProcedure. The date were obtained through a survey of 218 high schools. A three-part questionnaire was developed by a revision of the Anderson instrument. A panel of experts in the field assisted in the questionnaire\'s revision, and the arrangement of the statements into six role segments: Administrator, clerical aide, curriculum developer, equipment specialist, materials specialist, and teacher. Questionnaires were distributed by the principals. Responses were obtained from 133 principals, 136 library media specialists, and 366 teachers.\r\n\r\nSummary of Findings and Conclusions. Four hypotheses were formulated and tested by item analyses, discriminant analysis, and multiple analysis of variance (MANOVA). The following conclusions and findings were drawn: (1) There were significant differences between the actual views of library media specialists and the views of teachers and principals. (2) There were significant differences between the library media specialists\' perceptions of the views of teachers and principals and the actual views of teachers and principals. (3) There were significant differences between the actual views of teachers and the actual views of principals for the role of library media specialist. (4) Library media specialists are generally evaluated on the same form as classroom teachers. (5) More teachers, than library media specialists, are responsible for computers in high school programs. (6) Fewer library media specialists have actual classroom teaching experience than they did in 1970. (7) Principals and library media specialists have extremely limited experience or instruction in each others\' field.','School administration','Library science','','0','8420069'),(599,'PREDICTION OF RESOURCE NEEDS: A MODEL BUDGET FORMULA FOR UPPER DIVISION UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES','DT',1975,'SPYERS-DURAN, PETER','Ed.D.','Nova University','','','','','','','','','','','','','United States','Nova University','United States','questionnaire','','','http://login.ezproxy.library.ualberta.ca/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/302780860?accountid=14474','Not available.

Four groups were established including teachers and students, and information was gathered regarding gender and grade level.\r\n\r\nA researcher constructed questionnaire was administered to 26 teachers and 78 students representing grades 7-12. The questionnaire consisted of ten statements comparing the suspension programs and five statements describing characteristics of the in-school program. The respondent was asked to agree or disagree to varying degrees according to a Likert-type scale. Included in the questionnaire was one open-ended question which allowed the respondent to state opinions regarding the suspension programs. The data were collected and analyzed using measures of central tendency, T-tests, one way analysis of variance, and Scheffe tests. The findings of significant differences were reported at the 0.05 level of significance.\r\n\r\nThe study found that respondents expressed a stronger preference for the effects of the in-school suspension program. The study found that students are more likely to feel that rule breakers are penalized if they are assigned to in-school suspension. However, the study further found that home suspension serves to more greatly discourage students from repeating an offense because of parental involvement. Female teachers and students tended to have a more positive perception of the in-school suspension program than their male counterparts and the junior high teachers and students tended to record higher scores for in-school suspension than their senior high counterparts.\r\n\r\nBased on the data collected and the conclusions arrived at by the researcher, the study recommends changes be made to the in-school suspension program including increased teacher assistance, counseling, parental involvement, and improved communications between the alternative center and the classroom teachers.','School administration','Library science','','0','8903425'),(601,'Equal access to library materials: An administrative problem of restructuring the libraries in Hawaii to provide equal access','DT',1977,'Gotanda, Masae','Ed.D.','University of Southern California','','','','','','','','','','','','','United States','University of Southern California','United States','questionnaire','statistical anaylsis','','http://login.ezproxy.library.ualberta.ca/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1625428168?accountid=14474','Not available.

These factors are: consideration and structure values, mobility, mentors, uninterrupted careers, publishing, professional networking, and leadership training.\r\n\r\nThe population consisted of librarians serving in administrative capacities in university and college libraries, library schools, academic library programs, and public library systems in the United States and Canada. A total of 210 were surveyed and 114 useable questionnaires were returned for a response rate of 54.7%.\r\n\r\nThe Leadership Opinion Questionnaire authored by E. A.

The results identified three career paths indicating the age the respondents were when first achieving a leadership role: early, mid or late career. The results further indicated that the respondents scored higher on both consideration and structure values than national norms. The study indicates that women in public library systems received appointments to leadership positions at an earlier age than university and library school leaders. Additionally, publishing did not aid the public library leaders since this group published the least of all groups studied.

A literature search was conducted to isolate the principles of budget reporting and the methods and techniques discussed in both library and business literature. A questionnaire was then developed and an interview schedule set up with academic libraries in Massachusetts to examine the actual methods and techniques used in budget reporting. The questionnaire was pretested on a representative sample of large, medium and small size private and public institutions of higher learning in Massachusetts. The questionnaire was sent to institutions accredited by the appropriate accrediting body, chartered by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, had a enrollment of at least 100 students and contained a library of at least 20,000 volumes.\r\n\r\nThe results showed that budget presentations were not limited to a specific time nor were they always consciously pursued as part of \"the budget presentations.\" Library directors must fully understand the purpose of budget presentations and must be involved in the establishment of an atmosphere conducive to successful budget presentations. The budget statements must contain sufficient information, realistically presented within the context of the goals and objectives of the library and the larger institution, to be knowledgeably appraised and evaluated. The budget must be flexible, contain priorities and alternative plans succinctly, logically, and clearly presented. The report should adhere to the principles of good report writing, containing a narrative section that delineates the objectives, courses of action, conclusions and recommendations based on a thorough analysis of the findings that the library should follow. Certain cautions were expressed that the report should not contain more information than necessary, should not be padded--that is, ask for more than the institution can realistically provide and not contain comparative data and standards that raise questions of applicability.

The relationships between selected socio-economic variables and school library variables were also examined, as well as factors that had encouraged and hindered the growth of school libraries.\r\n\r\nThe framework for comparison, which consisted of a series of indicators and variables, was established by surveying a panel of thirty experts on school librarianship in twenty-nine countries. The five highest ranked indicators were the existence and extent of school libraries, personnel, facilities, materials and equipment, and the role of the school library and the teacher-librarian.\r\n\r\nThe indicators were then used as a basis to survey the current state of school libraries internationally. Sixty-four countries responded to the survey. Among the major findings were that although centralized school libraries existed in most of the responding countries, the library was seen as either a supplementary or a non-essential service. In more than 75% of the responding countries, the typical school library had a person in charge, but he or she was often without a defined role or had a basic role of making the resources available. The typical library contained printed, audio and visual materials; computers and communication equipment were present in less than 25% of them.\r\n\r\nTwo strong relationships were observed. The presence of libraries in primary schools had a strong positive correlation with the gross national product per capita of the country, but had a strong negative correlation with the percentage of the population in a country under the age of 15.\r\n\r\nThe most frequently mentioned factors encouraging growth of school libraries were the availability of funds, the role of a central organization, and the education/training of teacher-librarians, whereas the most frequently mentioned factors hindering growth were the inadequacy or total absence of funds, the lack of trained personnel, and problems related to physical facilities.\r\n\r\nThe appendices include the two survey instruments and a list of official sources of information on school libraries in the responding countries.','Library science','School administration','','0','9334270'),(614,'A comparative study of the perceptions of the school library media specialist\'s role as perceived by principals, teachers, and school library media specialists in public schools in the State of Kuwait','DT',1997,'Ali, Abdulrazzaq Hussain','Ph.D.','The Florida State University','','','','','','','','','','','','','United States','The Florida State University','United States','questionnaire ','Factor analysis','T-tests and Levene\'s tests','http://login.ezproxy.library.ualberta.ca/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/304340952?accountid=14474','The purpose of this study was to investigate the divergence and congruence in the role perceptions of the school library media specialists (SLMS) held by principals, teachers, and SLMS at elementary, intermediate, and secondary school levels in the State of Kuwait.

The study further sought to compare the actual role of the SLMS with the role of the SLMS defined in Information Power (ALA, 1988).\r\n\r\nThe Role Expectations of Library Media Specialists (RELMS), an attitude questionnaire developed for studying media specialists\' perceptions of role was used in this study. On a five point Likert-type scale, respondents were asked to indicate their strength of agreement or disagreement with the way things really are in their school library media centers. The questionnaire was handed to a sample of 600 respondents and a total of 83% response rate was obtained. The Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) computer program was used in this study. Factor analysis was performed and four factors emerged: Teaching/Instructional Consultant Role, Management Role, Traditional Role, and Media Role. T-tests and Levene\'s tests were performed to test for differences between groups and within the SLMS group.\r\n\r\nFindings indicated that there were no significant differences between teachers and principals as to their perceptions of role of the SLMS. Significant differences in perceptions were found between teachers and SLMS for the Teaching/Instructional Role, and Management Role, and no significant differences were found between them for the Traditional Role and the Media Role. At the 0.05 level, role perceptions held by principals were statistically significant from the perceptions of SLMS for all roles except for the Traditional Role. No significant differences in perceptions were found among the SLMS themselves at different school levels. Also, no significant differences were found among SLMS of different education levels.

The purposes of the study were (a) to discover the predominant leadership pattern of research university library directors as perceived by themselves and by their subordinates; and (b) to investigate the relationship between leadership behaviors and the outcomes expressed in terms of extra effort from subordinates, effectiveness, and satisfaction.\r\n\r\nSubjects of the study included 29 directors of American research university libraries that were members of the Association of Research Libraries. The Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire-5X was used to collect the data. Based on information from 27 library directors evaluating themselves and 146 subordinates evaluating 28 directors, the study revealed that transformational leadership was the predominant leadership pattern of research university library directors, and that transformational leadership behaviors had stronger positive relationship to outcomes than did transactional leadership and non-leadership behaviors. Additionally, research university library directors considered themselves to exhibit transformational leadership behaviors (Idealized Influence, Inspirational Leadership, Intellectual Stimulation), and one transactional behavior (Contingent Reward) at a significantly higher level than did their subordinates. Library directors also thought they were able to encourage more extra effort from subordinates and were more effective than did their subordinates. Male directors were perceived to exhibit higher levels of one transactional leadership behavior (Management-by-Exception (Passive)), and non-leadership behavior (Laissez-Faire) than female directors. Conversely, female directors were perceived to exhibit higher levels of transformational leadership behaviors (Attributed Charisma, Inspirational Leadership, and Intellectual Stimulation) and to be more effective and more satisfied than male directors. Library directors with 20 years or less experience were perceived to utilize one transformational leadership behavior (Inspirational Leadership) more frequently and to be more satisfied than library directors with more than 20 years experience.

Although planning has been a frequent topic in library literature, little is known about what planning is actually occurring in small academic libraries. This study determined how many small academic libraries plan, the types of planning used in small academic libraries, and the perceived effectiveness of the planning in small academic libraries that do plan.\r\n\r\nSmall academic libraries were defined as libraries at institutions of higher education with 4,000 or fewer student enrollment. The researcher mailed the questionnaire, \"A Characterization of Planning in Small Academic Libraries,\" to the directors of approximately 600 small academic libraries.\r\n\r\nTwo hundred sixty-eight directors of small academic libraries returned the survey. The responses showed that 38 libraries did not plan; 59 libraries used operational planning; 133 libraries used tactical planning; and 38 libraries used strategic planning. Using the T-test, the study determined that there was not a significant relationship between type of small academic library and level of planning (none, operational, tactical, or strategic). Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) determined that there was a significant relationship among librarians\' perceptions of the influence of the institution\'s planning on library planning, but there was not a significant difference among librarians\' perceptions of the influence of the institution\'s accrediting agency on library planning.\r\n\r\nAnalysis of Variance (ANOVA) also showed that there was a significant difference among librarians\' perceptions of the result of types of planning on changing the goals of the library. There was not a significant difference among librarians\' perceptions of the result of types of planning on better use of resources, on increasing funding, on improving the image of the library, on changing policies or procedures of the library, or on improving services to faculty and staff.\r\n\r\nAlthough the study found statistical significance on only two of the variables, the directors did agree that planning had a positive influence on resources, funding, image, policies, and services.','Library science','School administration','','0','9812030'),(618,'Selection aid use for book purchases among school library media specialists in Missouri','DT',1996,'Worthington, Kaye H.','M.S.','Central Missouri State University','','','','','','','','','','','','','United States','Central Missouri State University','United States','questionnaire ','','','http://login.ezproxy.library.ualberta.ca/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/304324689?accountid=14474','This study explored the use of selection aids by Missouri school library media specialists through selection aid purchases or borrowing selection aids from other sources, addressed selection aid preferences of school library media specialists, and researched budgetary spending for selection aid purchases.

School library media specialists were asked to indicate selection aid purchases of both monographs and serial publications, use of the Internet as a selection aid source, and budgetary information through past and planned expenditures. Eighty-seven percent of the respondents indicated selection aid subscriptions.

Seven null hypotheses were generated for this investigation.\r\n\r\nThere was no statistically significant difference found between the three groups perceptions concerning which roles media specialists are performing now. There was no statistically significant difference found between principals\' and media specialists\' beliefs concerning which roles media specialists should perform. A statistically significant relationship was found, however, between beliefs of principals and teachers and between the beliefs of media specialists and teachers concerning which roles the media specialists should perform.

A 1983 statement by a prominent librarian, Jesse Shera, recants his and the profession\'s assertion that information science is the theoretical and intellectual basis for librarianship. What social and ideational values led to that original and now rejected assertion?\r\n\r\nAnalyzing the conventions of interpretation employed by librarians, one finds that although they have incorporated such mythical phrases as \"scholar-librarians,\" or \"the library is the heart of the university,\" their interpretative conventions reveal a subordinate academic and social standing. An ill-defined \"science\" and \"research\" promise to elevate the profession but instead become interpretative conventions that lead the profession to adopt the equally ill-defined specialty, information science, as a model. That information science is a governmental policy of control of access to ideas has escaped the purview of librarians.\r\n\r\nThroughout the literature defining librarianship, we see the influence of external agents: Coupled with occasional conflicts with faculty has been the ambition to be known as faculty. The Carnegie Corporation of New York studies added to the desire to separate clerical from professional duties. Carnegie donations founded the Graduate Library School (GLS) of the University of Chicago which in turn promoted the ideas of \"research\" and \"science.\" Elites of the profession have been associated with GLS or influenced by its graduates. Librarians noted the status extended to documentalists, who performed library-like work in the service of science, industry, and government but who escaped the burden of the library name. Computer applications in Documentation (later changed to information science) promised similar status to librarians who would adopt those procedures.\r\n\r\nInterpretative conventions of subordinate status have unwittingly reproduced subordination for librarians. The movement into information science has been done without understanding either the latter\'s origin and nature as a governmental control agency or the nature of scholarly research and use of library resources.','School administration','Library science','','0','8710688'),(624,'CHALLENGES TO LIBRARY BOOKS IN THE PUBLIC HIGH SCHOOLS OF MISSISSIPPI, 1978-1985: A SURVEY OF HIGH SCHOOL LIBRARY MEDIA SPECIALISTS','DT',1986,'WILDMAN, MARY GAIL','Ed.D.','The University of Southern Mississippi','','','','','','','','','','','','','United States','The University of Southern Mississippi','United States','questionnaire ','','','http://login.ezproxy.library.ualberta.ca/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/303434444?accountid=14474','The research was designed to determine the relationship between the number of challenges to library books in the public high schools of Mississippi and the following community demographic variables: educational level, types (agricultural, educational, professional, white collar, blue collar) or employment of residents, community type (rural, urban, suburban), economic conditions, and the geographic location within the state. Additional research was designed to determine the relationship of types (political, sexual, religious, language, racial) of challenges to library books and the same demographic variables.\r\n\r\nThe procedure for gathering information was through a 22-item questionnaire plus a list of 25 controversial titles sent to 326 public high school library media specialists (grades 9 through 12) in the state of Mississippi. A response of 59 percent was received. Data from the 1980 census and from the State Department of Education were combined with the results of the questionnaire to provide more data concerning possible causes of challenges to library books in Mississippi public schools.\r\n\r\nOf 189 responses, only 60 schools reported challenges to library titles; however, there were 93 challenges to 67 titles, only 12 of which were on the most controversial list. Only 9.87 percent of the variance in predicting the number of challenges might be explained by the influence of the demographic variables listed in the study. Possible reasons for the lack of significant differences may be the homogeneity of the population and the lack of response from the non-white sections of the state.\r\n\r\nFurther study is recommended concerning circulation of materials and reading choices of students.

Four groups were established including teachers and students, and information was gathered regarding gender and grade level.\r\n\r\nA researcher constructed questionnaire was administered to 26 teachers and 78 students representing grades 7-12. The questionnaire consisted of ten statements comparing the suspension programs and five statements describing characteristics of the in-school program. The respondent was asked to agree or disagree to varying degrees according to a Likert-type scale. Included in the questionnaire was one open-ended question which allowed the respondent to state opinions regarding the suspension programs. The data were collected and analyzed using measures of central tendency, T-tests, one way analysis of variance, and Scheffe tests. The findings of significant differences were reported at the 0.05 level of significance.\r\n\r\nThe study found that respondents expressed a stronger preference for the effects of the in-school suspension program. The study found that students are more likely to feel that rule breakers are penalized if they are assigned to in-school suspension. However, the study further found that home suspension serves to more greatly discourage students from repeating an offense because of parental involvement. Female teachers and students tended to have a more positive perception of the in-school suspension program than their male counterparts and the junior high teachers and students tended to record higher scores for in-school suspension than their senior high counterparts.\r\n\r\nBased on the data collected and the conclusions arrived at by the researcher, the study recommends changes be made to the in-school suspension program including increased teacher assistance, counseling, parental involvement, and improved communications between the alternative center and the classroom teachers.','School administration','Library science','','0','8903425'),(631,'Structural and individual influences on information behavior: A national study of adolescents\' use of public libraries','DT',2009,'Sin, Sei-Ching Joanna','Ph.D.','The University of Wisconsin - Madison','','','','','','','','','','','','','United States','The University of Wisconsin - Madison','United States','survey','','','http://login.ezproxy.library.ualberta.ca/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/305029175?accountid=14474','This study proposed and tested a Person-In-Environment (PIE) framework to evaluate the relative impact of social-structural and personal factors on an individual\'s information behavior. In contrast to the focus on individual-level variables, the PIE framework integrates measures of an individual\'s information and socio-economic environments at the family and neighborhood levels.\r\n\r\nThe PIE framework is applied to identify those factors influencing the use of public libraries by 12th-graders for schoolwork, non-schoolwork and Internet access. Drawing from the Education Longitudinal Study (ELS), this study analyzed a national sample of more than 13,000 students. Data from each of the respondents is mapped to his/her residential neighborhood, public library, and socioeconomic data using ArcGIS, a Geographic Information System. By integrating data from the ELS, the Public Libraries Survey and the U.S. Census, this study provides a multivariate analysis of both individual factors (such as demographics, academic motivation, and reading) and structural factors (such as the accessibility of public libraries and neighborhood income levels). Structural Equation Modeling is used to test the model.\r\n\r\nThe study reveals that there exists prevalent information inequality. There is unequal availability of print and digital resources at the students\' homes, schools, and neighborhood public libraries based on socio-economic status, race/ethnicity, and gender. The research also finds that school information environment, frequency of school library use, and race/ethnicity are the top three factors affecting the students\' frequency of public library use.\r\n\r\nThis study demonstrates that, even after controlling for individual differences, structural environment has a significant impact on an individual\'s use of information resources. It is thus paramount for information behavior research to incorporate measures of social-structural inequality. This study also has information policy implications; it shows that one cannot dismiss the lower level of information use as simply a matter of personal disposition. Structural inequality in information resources distribution can depress an individual\'s library use. More resources need to be devoted to schools and library systems in disadvantaged neighborhoods to facilitate their use and help rectify the information and digital divide.\r\n\r\nDetails','Library science','','','0','3384534'),(632,'The process of change at the Graduate School of Sciences and Technologies of the Information in the development of distance education','DT',2005,'Velez Gonzalez, Julia Y.','Ed.D.','University of Puerto Rico, Rio Piedras','','','','','','','','','','','','','United States','University of Puerto Rico, Rio Piedras','United States','interviews ','review of documents','','http://login.ezproxy.library.ualberta.ca/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/305367928?accountid=14474','The members of the educative organizations are exposed to constants and diverse changes in conduct in their daily activities.

Vygotsky’s (1987) theory of tool mediation suggests that cultural tools, such as computer software influence individuals’ thinking and action. However, it is not completely understood how technology and other resources influence student action. Middle school students are a particularly an understudied population. This qualitative study examined how material and psychological tools, including the presentational software tools PowerPoint and Prezi mediate middle school students’ actions when conducting research for two Earth Science research projects. Six eighth-grade students recorded computer screencasts and dialogue while conducting their research. I collected data from transcripts of computer screencasts, student interviews, and artifacts. Prior to coding, I established four major themes with 20 sub-categories. The four themes were content knowledge, previous tool use, resource use, and tool use. I segmented and coded the transcripts to reflect which different tools mediated student action. An analysis of the data revealed that library resources and the special features of PowerPoint and Prezi programs did not influence actions. Instead, I discovered that the assignment requirements and research topic content were the primary mediators of actions and behavior. However, despite the overall influence of the assignment requirements and topic content, each student employed different tools to complete each assignment. The results suggest that a variety of resources should be available to meet the individualistic tool use of students. The results also suggest that educators design less structured assignments that promote and encourage student centered learning and tool use.','Library science','Middle School education','Educational technology','0','10111334'),(635,'Bibliotherapy: An examination of school counselors\' attitudes and use','DT',2009,'Townsend, Karen S.

For students to acquire the information and technology literacy education they need, school libraries must be staffed with qualified individuals who can fulfill the librarian’s role as leader, teacher, instructional partner, information specialist, and program administrator. Principals are typically given decision rights for hiring staff, including school librarians. Research shows that principals have limited knowledge of the skills and abilities of the school librarian or the specific needs and functions of the library program. Research also indicates that those with specific knowledge of school library programs, namely school district library supervisors, are only consulted on recruiting and hiring about half the time. School districts entrust library supervisors with responsibilities such as professional development of school librarians only after they are hired.\r\n\r\nThis study uses a theoretical lens from research on IT governance, which focuses on the use of knowledge-fit in applying decision rights in an organization. This framework is appropriate because of its incorporation of a specialist with a specific knowledge set in determining the placement of input and decision rights in the decision-making processes. The method used in this research was a multiple-case study design using five school districts as cases, varying by the involvement of the supervisors and other individuals in the hiring process. The data collected from each school district were interviews about the district’s recruiting and hiring practices with principals, an individual in HR, library supervisors, and recently hired school librarians. Data analysis was conducted through iterative coding from themes in the research questions, with continuous adjustments as new themes developed.\r\n\r\nResults from the study indicate that governance framework is applicable to evaluating the decision-making processes used in recruiting and hiring school librarians. However, a district’s use of governance did not consistently use knowledge-fit in the determination of input and decision rights. In the hiring process, governance was more likely to be based on placing decision rights at a certain level of the district hierarchy rather than the location of specific knowledge, most often resulting in site-based governance for decision rights at the school-building level. The governance of the recruiting process was most affected by the shortage or surplus of candidates available to the district to fill positions. Districts struggling with a shortage of candidates typically placed governance for the decision-making process on recruiting at the district level, giving the library supervisor more opportunity for input and collaboration with human resources. In districts that use site-based governance and that place all input and decision rights at the building level, some principals use their autonomy to eliminate the school library position in the allotment phase or hire librarians that, while certified through testing, do not have the same level of expertise as those who achieve certification through LIS programs. The principals in districts who use site-based governance for decision rights but call on the library supervisor for advisement stated how valuable they found the supervisor’s expertise in evaluating candidates for hire. In no district was a principal or school required to involve the library supervisor in the hiring of school librarians. With a better understanding of the tasks involved, the effect of district governance on decision-making, and the use of knowledge to assign input and decision rights, it is possible to look at how all of these factors affect the outcome in the quality of the hire. A next step is to look at the hiring process that school librarians went through and connect those with the measurable outcomes of hiring: school librarian success, retention, and attrition; the quality of school library program services, outreach, and involvement in a school; and the perceptions of the success of the school librarian and the library program as seen from students, teachers, administrators, parents, and other community stakeholders.','Library science','School administration','Information science','0','10130024'),(638,'Improving Reading and Technology Skills in At-Risk Teens Through Librarian-Led Mentoring Activities: An Action Research Study','DT',2014,'McDowell, Chantell L.','D.A.','Franklin Pierce University','','','','','','','','','','','','','United States','Franklin Pierce University','United States','qualitative','interview','observation','http://login.ezproxy.library.ualberta.ca/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1620833078?accountid=14474','At-risk students have a complicated scenario of needs that arise from multiproblem situations and self-destructive behaviors. In schools, literacy is one basic need. Socially and economically disadvantaged students often read below grade level early in their school careers and are moved forward regardless of literacy competency. The No Child Left Behind Act\'s requirement to demonstrate adequate yearly progress has made it more difficult for schools to justify this behavior; however, teaching literacy skills to disaffected youth has become highly problematic because teachers are attempting to manage behaviors while teaching their students. Librarians are highly skilled in literacy and technology, but, ironically, they are isolated from the daily academics of the school and have a reputation as staff who just \"find books\" for children and conduct literature searches.\r\n\r\nIn an inner-city middle school in North Carolina, various programs were initiated to attempt to address academic problems and increase adequate yearly progress. The author of this study, a librarian, developed a program for this school that was designed to enhance the literacy and technological skills of several students who were identified as most \"at risk.\" Concentrating on one-to-one mentoring with school and public librarians, the author developed a 5-month program called the Weekly Readers Program, which involved specific weekly curricula, goals, and assignments oriented toward developing students\' literacy and technological skills. Using one-on-one mentoring and focusing on students\' self-reflections, the program demonstrated significant successes in many areas, including a drop in antisocial behavior and an increase in self-esteem.\r\n\r\nThe focus of this study was to determine the effects of a librarian-student mentoring program on the academic, behavioral, absenteeism, and self-esteem outcomes of at-risk students in an urban North Carolina middle school. The author utilized a social-action research method and continued to gather data and to modify the program through short feedback loops from student feedback and personal observations. The sample consisted of 10 at-risk, urban middle school students; additionally, 10 librarians served as the mentor population. Qualitative data from this study showed significant improvement in participants\' attitudes toward school and their ability to comprehend information in all forms during and after mentoring. Significant outcomes surfaced for participants\' disciplinary referrals, which decreased for all participants by the end of the mentoring experience. An improvement in student self-efficacy was also noted in a presurvey-postsurvey evaluation model. These improvements suggest that the mentoring effects of a caring professional librarian can have far-reaching results in an at-risk student\'s life.','Library science','Educational leadership','School counseling','0','3640150'),(639,'Student Literature Access in an Online School: A Program Evaluation','DT',2013,'Hibbard, Laura E.','Ph.D.','Ohio University','','','','','','','','','','','','','United States','Ohio University','United States','focus groups','interviews','surveys','http://login.ezproxy.library.ualberta.ca/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1649153498?accountid=14474','School libraries have historically served an important role in students\' access to quality literature. Students who attend schools virtually, or through online schools, are typically not afforded the luxury of borrowing books from classroom libraries or through school libraries. Many students who attend online schools are economically-disadvantaged and access their education through school-provided computers and internet access. Impoverished students often have a lack of literature in their homes and rely on school libraries to fulfill the need.\r\n\r\nThis study, a program evaluation, followed an online school\'s inaugural year in instituting a school library system, replete with both physical books and ebooks. A mixed methods approach was taken, utilizing data from teacher and administrator focus groups, student and parent interviews, student and parent surveys, library use records, and students\' DIBELS, or oral reading fluency scores.\r\n\r\nIt was found that stakeholders were generally pleased with the libraries and asked for more books and additional genres, such as graphic novels and historical fiction. Stakeholders cited the main goal of the library being to \"get books into the hands of the students.” The library in the school study lacked a true leader though, and communication suffered. Teachers requested that Library be considered a special, in ways similar to how physical education and computer classes were offered, primarily to help lure reluctant readers to use the resources. It was found that students who accessed the libraries most were those who were already motivated readers. Stakeholders requested that the school consider purchasing mobile digital reading devices so that reading ebooks would be easier for the students than reading on their desktop computers.\r\n\r\nConclusions were that it is an essential role for online schools to provide students access to literature. To empower students to fully access library resources, a strong librarian is needed to serve as an instructional partner, an information specialist, a teacher, and a program administrator, following the recommendation of the American Association of School Librarians. The final conclusion was that ebooks can be a valuable literature resource for online schools, but that students report fatigue and difficulty reading from desktop computers, thus hampering reading motivation.','Library science','Educational evaluation','Literacy','0','3672674'),(640,'Combined school /public libraries in the United States: Three comparative case studies','DT',2002,'Moorman, John A.','Ph.D.','University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign','','','','','','','','','','','','','United States','University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign','United States','surveys','questionnaires','comparison','http://login.ezproxy.library.ualberta.ca/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/305618599?accountid=14474','A detailed examination of the literature on combined school/public libraries is presented. Out of this examination, and this investigator\'s experience, a research question and hypotheses were developed to examine the question of whether increased cooperation between school and public libraries is more efficient than combined facilities in providing library service in all but the smallest locations.\r\n\r\nThe case study method was used in testing the hypotheses. Demographic data was employed in selecting separate and combined school/public library sites in three population categories. Sites selected were Greentown and Eastern Howard Public Library (Indiana) and Fortville-Vernon Public Library (Indiana) in the 5,000–10,000 population category, Pamlico County Library (North Carolina) and Graham Public Library (North Carolina) in the 10,001–25,000 population category, and Azalea Branch Library and Media Center (Florida) and Dunedin Public Library (Florida) in the above 25,001 population category.\r\n\r\nData on user and staff perception of library facilities and services was collected at each site through user surveys, and staff questionnaires. Selected operational data was also collected from each study site. A comparison of library collection holdings was made using the American Library Association\'s Books Challenged or Banned in 1996–1997.\r\n\r\nData analysis included a comparison of data from the user questionnaires, and operational data from the combined school/public library site, and the separate public library site in each population category. User survey data from the universe of separate sites in the study was compared with user survey data from the universe of combined school/public library sites in the study. Responses to the staff surveys were presented and analyzed.\r\n\r\nFrom this data analysis, conclusions were made concerning the validity of the hypotheses tested.

Instead of telling the average performance among libraries examined, this method, with a proper model of library inputs and outputs, can be used as a means of identifying the best practices in some peer group and provides an efficiency score for each library, with a specific recommendation for efficiency improvement. DEA incorporates the idea of benchmarking and extends it to situations with many resources and services, called “inputs” and “outputs” respectively.\r\n\r\nThe study uses the annual statistics from the Association of Research Libraries (ARL) for the population of 95 academic research libraries in the U.S. For the purpose of valid peer comparison, the libraries are grouped by the main funding source of the parent institutions (publicly funded vs. privately funded).\r\n\r\nThe results show that the DEA technique can be applied to the evaluation of academic research libraries, yielding a reasonable discriminating power among libraries when external information based on existing cost studies is added to the basic DEA model, in the form of constraints. DEA also provides quite consistent results over the two-year period (1995–1996) that I tested. I examined the effect of individual variables on the efficiency scores to seek a good set of variables for further application. The results show that the technique is robust against tests including the presence of random noise in the data.\r\n\r\nThe study is based on secondary, statistical data. Thus, the results of this study should be regarded as documentary evidence on the problem of technical efficiencies in the libraries examined. I believe that complete assessment of the efficiencies at the academic libraries will require understanding the local context of individual libraries.\r\n\r\nDetails','Library science','School administration','','0','9947890'),(642,'Special education: Policy and provision within one Education and Library Board in Northern Ireland','DT',1998,'Cunningham, Peter Gerald','Ph.D.','Queen\'s University Belfast','','','','','','','','','','','','','United Kingdom','Queen\'s University Belfast','United Kingdom','questionnaires','interviews ','','http://login.ezproxy.library.ualberta.ca/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/304473200?accountid=14474','This research examines education provision for pupils who have a statement of special educational need, as specified by the 1986 (NI) Order, in an Education and Library Board in Northern Ireland as such provision existed in March 1994.\r\n\r\nTeachers, administrators and parent/guardians completed self-administered questionnaires. In addition to interviews with respondents from each group, interviews with children were also conducted. Supplementary interviews were sought from administrators within the ELB and from professionals outside it. Two case studies were undertaken. The first was a secondary comprehensive school; the second was a college of further education. Archival and statistical documents were analysed to frame the development provision in a historical context.\r\n\r\nFindings were explored under headings of administration, curricular integration. Wide variations in interpretation of special education terms were identified in and between groups. Poor communication between groups also contributed to this confusion, and while ELB administrators saw little wrong with the system, teachers and parent/guardians felt far from satisfied with various aspects. The research discovered that whilst the majority of respondents were supportive, at an ideological level, of the principle of integrating statemented children into mainschool contexts, at a practical level such support was rarely in evidence.\r\n\r\nAn apparent lack of knowledge on the part of many mainstream teachers regarding special education curricular issues was discovered. The lack of access to specialist subject teachers, by statemented pupils, was a source of some concern. Mainschool teachers were critical of the apparent lack of support for special educational initiatives from a range of statutory bodies. Special school teachers expressed no such sentiments. Though all teachers were critical of the lack of special education In-set provision.\r\n\r\nOverall, these results suggest that statemented pupils are not getting their full curricular entitlement and are viewed a separate grouping in education circles.','Special education','School administration','','0','706664'),(643,'Diseño para la elaboración de un proyecto para el establecimiento de bibliotecas escolares en las Escuelas Adventistas del Séptimo Día en México','DT',2005,'Suriano Guzman, Adan','M.I.S.','University of Puerto Rico, Rio Piedras','','','','','','','','','','','','','United States','University of Puerto Rico, Rio Piedras','United States','-','','','http://login.ezproxy.library.ualberta.ca/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/305397738?accountid=14474','La biblioteca escolar se concibe como un dinámico centro de recursos y un activo servicio de información que cumple un papel esencial en relación con el aprendizaje de los alumnos, con las tareas docentes y con el entorno social y cultural del centro.\r\n\r\nLa biblioteca escolar en México carece de un marco legal específico.

Advocacy for a school library program is the deliberate and sustained effort to foster understanding of the program while influencing the attitudes of key stakeholders. It includes raising awareness, increasing knowledge and gaining influence for the position of the school librarian. The national professional organization for school librarians, the American Association of School Librarians (AASL), maintains a multi-tiered definition of advocacy, with marketing and public relations existing under the definition of advocacy. This leads to varied understandings of advocacy among practicing school librarians and there is a lack of consistency in how school librarians interpret and engage in the practice of advocacy.\r\n\r\nThis study examines the advocacy beliefs of school librarians and the advocacy activities in which they engage in practice. It also explores the relationship between school librarians\' espoused practices of advocacy and their activities-in-use within their program. Finally, this study explores the perceived success of advocacy strategies used in school library programs by both the school librarians and their co-teacher and administrator stakeholders when engaging in advocacy for their program.\r\n\r\nUsing a mixed methods approach, a national sample of practicing school librarians working in 36 of the 100 largest school districts in the US were surveyed. A smaller criterion sample of survey respondents was interviewed, along with a co-teacher and administrator from each site, using phenomenological methods to examine the lived experiences of the participants in their school setting. Findings indicate the participants in this study had difficulty distinguishing the difference between the definition and activities of advocacy, marketing, and public relations as identified by AASL. Additionally, practicing school librarians had difficulty understanding advocacy in the context of the school library program. Among those school librarians who have a more mature understanding of advocacy, common strategies were used in their settings to change the perception of stakeholders. These strategies include revitalizing the position of the school librarian, emphasizing the teaching role of the school librarian, focusing on innovation, and ensuring relevance of the school library program so it meets the needs of today\'s learner.

Previous research had not generally considered the components necessary to formulate an instructional technology plan. This study focused on three research questions related to the formation of a technology plan. What were the components of technology plans? Who was included in the technology planning process? What was the role of the school library media specialist in developing and implementing a technology plan?\r\n\r\nThis descriptive study analyzed the technology plans and interviewed administrators and school library media specialists from twenty schools with \"lighthouse\" technology programs. The study also surveyed twenty-four school library media specialists from non-lighthouse schools to provide comparative data with the school library media specialists from the lighthouse technology schools.\r\n\r\nThe major findings of this study included the following points: (a) staff development for technology must be considered by the technology planning team, including how to find the time and resources necessary for the success of the program; (b) ongoing revision of the technology plan must be considered when developing a technology plan or the plan will not be able to keep up with changes in technology; (c) access to technology for both teachers and students is a factor in the implementation of a technology plan; (d) the development of a support structure for technology is a factor in the implementation of a technology plan; (e) at a minimum, the technology planning team should include representation from administration, teaching staff, and school library media specialists; and (f) lighthouse technology schools were more likely to have high quality school library media programs, as measured on Loertscher\'s Taxonomy of School Library Media Programs, than other schools.\r\n\r\nThese findings served as the basis for conclusions drawn from this study.

A majority of respondents were included to agree on inadequate library budget, lack of space, insufficient qualified personnel, and poor collections as the greatest limiting factors for library service. Despite some differences in their perceptions, a majority of the respondents viewed the current activities of librarians are relatively minimal; they felt librarians should be more involved in performing their duties.

The study examined the leadership beliefs and behavior of five Dominican Sisters who serve as principals in secondary schools owned by their respective Dominican congregations and compared the leadership of these principals to discover similarities in the articulation of the charism.\r\n\r\nThe examination of the Dominican charism was limited to three components: an orientation to study, a contemplative attitude and prayer, and collaboration based on mutual respect. Non-participant observation and semi-structured interviews were the methods used to assess the principals\' influence on the expression of these components in the beliefs and activities of selected faculty, the staff development program, the academic tone, the fine arts curriculum, the religious practices, and governance structures within the school.\r\n\r\nThe study found that (a) there was some diversity among the principals in relationship to their understanding of the charism, (b) there were common elements and values, communicated by four of the five principals and empowered in four of the five faculties, which illustrated the presence of the three components of the charism within the life of the school, and (c) the basic difference within the leadership of the principals was in the degree of communication and empowerment across the five principals and faculties. It concluded that these commonalities and differences speak to the issue of future leadership of Dominican secondary schools.\r\n\r\nThe study recommended that a task force of experienced Dominican principals develop a leadership renewal program which allows current principals to generate discussion on the charism with implications for educational leadership. It further recommended that models be developed which orient future principals to Dominican leadership from both a theoretical and practical perspective.\r\n\r\nThis study is significant because it seeks to initiate a discussion on the complex issue of institutionalizing the charism within Dominican secondary schools and points out that the role of leadership is crucial to this institutionalization.\r\n\r\nDetails','School administration','Library science','Language','0','9109247'),(649,'A critical analysis of the strategic decision-making process for information technology in academic libraries','DT',1997,'Bell, Steven Jay','Ed.D.','University of Pennsylvania','','','','','','','','','','','','','United States','University of Pennsylvania','United States','interview','Decision model','','http://login.ezproxy.library.ualberta.ca/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/304369019?accountid=14474','Acquiring large-scale information technology is a strategic decision for academic libraries. The Library Management System (LMS) is the nexus of an automated library\'s operations. Acquiring the LMS is a complex, challenging strategic decision, and is susceptible to complications that can undermine the decision process. A research library\'s LMS acquisition is examined to provide insight into the decision process, how it is conducted, and determinants of problem resolution.\r\n\r\nUsing a case study research design, the library\'s technology selection process was compared with one at the same university in which a new institution-wide financial management information system was acquired. Data were collected by participant interview, and decision committee documents. This study describes and critically analyzes each decision process, and then provides recommendations for improving an information technology acquisition decision process so that decision resolution is achievable.\r\n\r\nDecision models provide a technique for analyzing and interpreting decision events. A review of the decision making literature identified the Garbage Can Decision Making model as the most appropriate framework to critically analyze the LMS decision process. This model is particularly applicable to academic organizations, referred to in the model as organized anarchies. Their decision making is typically characterized by dysfunctional behavior. A series of research questions was used to collect evidence to ascertain whether or not the LMS decision can be adequately explained by the Garbage Can model.\r\n\r\nBecause the LMS decision process showed evidence of problematic preferences, weak access and decision structures, decision flight, and other characteristics of anarchic decision situations, this study confirmed that the Garbage Can Model is an appropriate framework to explain the library\'s decision process. Administrators will minimize conditions that lead to dysfunctional decisions by managing decision process ambiguity and decision process structure.\r\n\r\nA good technology decision process successfully assesses and manages the inherent risk of information technology acquisitions, achieves intended implementation goals, and does so while securing an outcome that is judged favorably by the university community. No guidelines may enable higher education institutions to eliminate anarchic decision situations. Proper management of decision ambiguity and structures can lead to better information technology decisions.','School administration','Library science','Higher education','0','9727008'),(650,'Efficiency evaluations of North American university libraries by data envelopment analysis','DT',1997,'Mann, Gillian Margaret','M.S.','McGill University','','','','','','','','','','','','','Canada','McGill University','Canada','parametric programming ','Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA)','','http://login.ezproxy.library.ualberta.ca/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/304430868?accountid=14474','A method for ranking efficient decision making units in Data Envelopment Analysis is suggested.

Those factors believed to affect programs and services were analyzed according to practice frequencies. The semi-structured interviews were analyzed qualitatively and recorded in narrative form.\r\n\r\nThe findings indicated that a majority of teacher-librarians believed most programs and services were important or very important. Equally, a majority revealed they were not providing instructional programs, and consultant or advocacy services, to any great extent. The interview data confirmed that lack of time, due to inadequate staffing patterns, was the factor most likely to restrict the teacher-librarians\' ability to provide quality programs and services.','School administration','Elementary education','Library science','0','MM08459'),(656,'Development and validation of a prototype instrument to be used in the appraisal of school library media specialists','DT',1990,'Kahler, Betty June','Ph.D.','University of North Texas','','','','','','','','','','','','','United States','University of North Texas','United States','survey ','','','http://login.ezproxy.library.ualberta.ca/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/303874249?accountid=14474','In Texas, school library media specialists are not included in the state-funded career ladder; therefore, the use of the standard classroom teacher evaluation instrument, which was developed by the state department of education, cannot be required in the appraisal of this position. As a result, the instruments used to evaluate library media specialists are developed by the school districts and vary in quality and comprehensiveness. Dissatisfaction with this process was expressed, both by library media specialists and by those performing the appraisals. To answer the number of requests for a sample instrument, a prototype instrument was developed.\r\n\r\nTo formulate an instrument that would incorporate the competencies desired in a school library media specialist, 61 appraisal forms from school districts were analyzed for commonalities. These 101 performance indicators were organized into four domains: library management and organization, curriculum responsibilities, library environment, and professional growth and responsibilities. A resulting job-relatedness survey was completed by 65 practicing library media specialists. Seventy-three performance indicators or parts of indicators were eliminated according to the rating of the measurability, importance, and frequency of the behavior. Thirty-six library administrators marked the ensuing survey in the same manner, eliminating 15 additional performance indicators or parts of indicators. The final evaluation instrument was field tested in seven school districts.\r\n\r\nAn examination of the indicators that were eliminated or retained reveals perceptions of the competencies expected of the school library media specialist. The elimination of indicators covering planning, goal setting, flexible scheduling of classes, and involvement in curriculum development indicates a lack of vision. Despite encouragement to evaluate the indicators from a global perspective, many respondents are unable to divorce themselves from the local situation. The inclusion of indicators promoting planning with teachers for library skills instruction and correlation of library skills with classroom instruction indicates a desire to participate in the instructional process.','Library science','School administration','Educational evaluation','0','9114117'),(657,'User expectations and perceptions of library service quality of an academic library in Thailand','DT',1997,'Srisa-Ard, Surithong','Ph.D.','Illinois State University','','','','','','','','','','','','','United States','Illinois State University','United States','survey ','SERVQUAL instrument','survey ','http://login.ezproxy.library.ualberta.ca/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/304371729?accountid=14474','This study examined user expectations for and perceptions of library service quality at an academic library at Mahasarakham University (MSU), Thailand focusing on three service areas: (a) circulation; (b) reference; and (c) computer information service.

Library service quality was measured through a Thai translation of the SERVQUAL instrument as adapted by Danuta Ann Nitecki for use in academic libraries. A follow-up survey of library staff based on the findings of the SERVQUAL instrument was developed by the researcher to prioritize actions for service improvement. The subjects of this study consisted of 582 graduate students, 84 faculty members of Mahasarakham University, and 25 professional library staff members.\r\n\r\nSeveral insights were gained in terms of potentially unmet expectations for service, the relative values users place on different dimensions of service quality, the specific problems users have encountered in the past six months, and the ways librarians and library staff feel that the library at MSU can better meet user expectations. At the same time, the study provided insights into potential weaknesses in the approach used to garner these insights. It also suggested the danger of taking an extreme view of the primacy of user perceptions in studies of library service quality.

A Technical Services Statistics Survey Form was developed in order to collect statistical data from the technical services managers participating in the study. The Myers-Briggs Type Indicator was utilized to record managers\' personal management style. Thirty-two managers participated in the two-part study.\r\n\r\nThe hypothesis of the study was not supported because no significant differences in the predicted direction were found to exist between the use of the technical services statistics and management style groups as measured by the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator. (A Mann-Whitney U Test was used due to the small, uneven sample size.) There were significant differences between Sensing-Thinking (ST) and Intuitive-Feeling (NF) types, but not in the direction predicted by the hypothesis. Possible explanations for this unexpected finding include the very small sample size, the larger percentage of male respondents in the NF type, and the larger percentage of respondents from smaller institutions in the NF type.

Interviews with leaders in the field and a literature review provided a rationale for the 100-item survey completed in May, 1987, by 73 librarians in 19 states. Eight research questions addressed instructional objectives, student and staff training and applications, database selection, funding, and equipment.\r\n\r\nInstructional goals for the online information retrieval program were categorized as being at an awareness of level, a skills level, or a research tool level. Critical thinking skills, location and use of materials cited, and curriculum integration received more emphasis at the research tool level. Librarians provided most student instruction, generally four hours or less for 20% or fewer of all students. Teachers received some training at 27 of the 73 schools, but only 16 librarians reported more than 10% faculty involvement.\r\n\r\nMost librarians conducted online searches while students observed or actively participated. Students, librarians, and teachers perceived the program as being somewhat more effective and successful at the 29 schools where some students conducted independent searches.\r\n\r\nContent appropriate to the curriculum was the most important database selection criterion. Magazine Index was the most used of 91 databases listed and DIALOG was the primary database vendor.\r\n\r\nLack of teacher interest and cooperation was the major difficulty reported in achieving instructional goals. Other difficulties were inadequate library staff time, equipment, and funding.\r\n\r\nFew schools had written policies and record keeping was minimal. A recommendation was made that librarians, teachers, and administrators cooperatively develop a formal written policy with specific instructional goals and evaluation criteria.\r\n\r\nFifty-eight libraries considered the online information retrieval program to be \"very useful\" or \"useful to certain groups of students.\" Most librarians were enthusiastic and 46 planned to expand the program.\r\n\r\nRecommendations for further research focused on investigating equal access to online information databases, the impact of CD-ROM technology, and the establishment of criteria to evaluate online information retrieval programs in school libraries.','Information Systems','Library science','Educational software','0','8825746'),(660,'DETERMINING A JOB PERFORMANCE BASIS FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF AN INDIVIDUALIZED STAFF DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM FOR SCHOOL LIBRARY MEDIA SPECIALISTS','DT',1977,'BELL, GERALDINE WATTS','Ed.D.','The University of Alabama','','','','','','','','','','','','','United States','The University of Alabama','United States','-','','','http://login.ezproxy.library.ualberta.ca/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/302822358?accountid=14474','Not available.

The study also examined the relationship of the land-grant libraries\' planning to that of the parent universities.\r\n\r\nThe research was modeled after Meredith\'s (1985, 1987) studies of strategic planning in higher education institutions. Descriptive statistics were used to compile the data which were compared to Meredith\'s results. Responses were also sorted by geographical area to determine where strategic planning was most and least prevalent.\r\n\r\nThe majority of land-grant university libraries reported that they had done strategic planning, with the 1890 libraries being involved in planning to a greater extent than the 1862 libraries. The number validated as doing bona fide strategic planning was substantially smaller. Further, only one-third of the universities used the term \"strategic plan\" to describe their regular planning system. The top three reasons that land-grant university libraries had initiated strategic planning were to improve the quality of programs, help meet and adapt to needed change, and improve overall management capabilities. The processes and steps which land-grant university library administrators had used in doing strategic planning were developed and carried out primarily by library staff. Generally, the processes that were used most extensively during the strategic planning effort were also the most successful. The libraries were able to clarify and redefine their goals and objectives, clarify and redefine their mission and purpose, formulate and implement a library plan. The processes which were used least, and which were considered least successful, related to forecasting the external environment and matching external opportunities and threats with internal strengths and values.\r\n\r\nThe majority of the land-grant university libraries were somewhat satisfied with their planning and reported that strategic planning became easier with time. The greatest problem for the land-grant university libraries was an insufficient link between capital allocation and strategic planning. Although strategic planning was time-consuming, it produced improved communication and staff participation.

The hypothesis was that the adoption of automation as a technological innovation in a college library could be statistically predicted by using readily available measures of size and finances of the college library.\r\n\r\nEight library automation innovations were examined: (1) acquisitions systems, (2) circulation systems, (3) computer output microform catalogs (COMCAT), (4) micrcomputer use, (5) Online Computer Library Center (OCLC) or other bibliographic utility membership, (6) online searching, (7) online public access catalogs (OPAC), and (8) serials systems. Each innovation was separately examined to identify which of the following organizational size and finance variables would predict its adoption: (1) college student enrollment, (2) number of periodical subscriptions, (3) number of volumes in the library, (4) periodicals budget, (5) salary budget, (6) total library budget, and (7) total staff in the library.\r\n\r\nData were from statistics published in the American Library Directory and the Higher Education General Information Survey (HEGIS). The population was 1,000 four-year college libraries. The analysis was done using the BMDP stepwise discriminant analysis program with cross validation (BMDP7M).\r\n\r\nPredictors were found for seven of the eight innovations. No predictor was found for the COMCAT innovation. Predictors found were: Periodical budget for acquisitions systems, total budget and number of book volumes for circulation systems, salary budget and number of periodical titles for microcomputer use, total staff for OCLC, total budget and salary budget for online searching, salary budget and number of periodical titles for OPACs, and number of book volumes for serials systems.\r\n\r\nPercentage of correct prediction ranged from 59.9% to 95.2% in the derivation samples and from 64.6% to 92.4% in the cross validation samples. The percentage of variance accounted for ranged from 2.52% to 39.50%.\r\n\r\nThe conclusion was that size and finance variable could be used to predict adoption of technological innovations.

Utilizing the framework of role theory, this study describes and analyzes the role of the library director. The work of Kahn and his associates (Organizational Behavior Program of the University of Michigan\'s Survey Research Center) has served as a model.\r\n\r\nIn order to inquire as thoroughly and specifically as possible into the library director\'s perceptions regarding sources of role definition, relations with an immediate superior as a key role sender, and perceptions of role-related expectations within the academic community, interviews were conducted with twenty academic library directors. Influencing factors are viewed in terms of the director\'s perceptions regarding sources of role definition, with particular attention to the presence of conflict and ambiguity.\r\n\r\nThe library director\'s position is one for which many significant role senders are located in a different system or in another unit within the same organization. Two dimensions were initially distinguished: the amount of time the library director spends in contact with people outside the library and the perceived importance of such contacts. This study suggests that influence in colleges on the library is not a zero-sum variable.\r\n\r\nLacking any structured or formalized power over his superior, the library directors have a reduced ability to guarantee that the performance of this individual will be as they need and wish. So in compensation, the library directors rely heavily on the affective bonds of trust, respect, and liking. But due to an increased instability and administration, these bonds are unusually hard to create and maintain. Also studied were the lack of control over demands and resources, an increased external focus, the role influences of unionization as well as various management coping styles found most successful by library directors.','Management','Library science','School administration','0','550460'),(666,'A study of decision-making in Tennessee academic libraries that have chosen automated library systems','DT',1995,'Phillips, Patricia Alwood Rich','Ed.D.','Peabody College for Teachers of Vanderbilt University','','','','','','','','','','','','','United States','Peabody College for Teachers of Vanderbilt University','United States','interview','retrospective analysis','','http://login.ezproxy.library.ualberta.ca/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/304196496?accountid=14474','This study compares the decision-making process among libraries in Tennessee that have chosen automated library systems.

The attitudes were crucial to teacher and student use of the school\'s library media program. Principals who supported the library media program understood the changes from the traditional library to the media center and were helpful in moving the program into the mainstream of instruction.\r\n\r\nThe population consisted of all K-12 full-time and part-time principals in the public schools of Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Wyoming. Seventy-five principals from each state were selected and stratified randomly by grade level designation. A mailed questionnaire was used to elicit responses concerning demographics and attitudes. The focus of the attitude section concerned the following: importance of the media program and its relationship to school curriculum; importance of the media program and its relationship to school instructional objectives; facilitating and encouraging teacher and student use of the library media center; staff development and inservice opportunities regarding the library media program; procuring, allocating, and managing library media resources to support the school\'s educational program.

The literature reveals that librarians\' participation in shared governance is minimal and may continue to be so for a variety of reasons including, but not limited to, obstacles from faculty and administration, self-exclusion, and academic credentials.\r\n\r\nThe study surveys faculty leaders, including CAOs, from Alabama Council of Independent Colleges. Data collection includes part one of a commercially produced instrument, The Power Management Inventory ( PMI), and a modified University Shared Governance Survey (USGS) borrowed from a dissertation by Persson.\r\n\r\nThe PMI investigates the motivational type of faculty leaders and groups them into one of three types (“affiliative,” “personalized” or “socialized” power) as identified by motivational theorist, David C. McClelland. In this study, one (1) respondent ties two groups and is categorized as a “mixed” motivational type.\r\n\r\nThe USGS asks opinions of faculty leaders regarding issue areas where academic librarians may be allowed to participate in shared governance. Issue areas include academic, financial and personnel, institutional, and student affairs. Demographic data is also collected.\r\n\r\nAn Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) was applied to determine if there are any statistically significant differences between faculty leaders\' by motivational type and opinion. ANOVA testing revealed that there were no statistically significant differences between the faculty leaders\' motivational groups and their opinions about academic librarians\' participation in shared governance.

This study examined two groups with closely related missions to determine the extent of cooperation in meeting common goals and to identify areas in which communication and cooperation are yet unrealized. The purpose of this study was to assess perceptions of North Carolina middle school principals and media coordinators regarding the role of library media programs in the instructional process. Beliefs regarding the implementation of national library media standards were analyzed and related to the existence of certain essential middle school components and selected characteristics of principals and media coordinators. Finally, the congruence between the responses of principals and media coordinators was examined.\r\n\r\nThe study used a mail survey and focused group interviews to collect data. Current national library media standards and selected essential middle school components on which there is near consensus were the basis for the questionnaire developed specifically for this study.\r\n\r\nOut of a population of 344, a total of 308 (90%) principals and media coordinators participated in the study. Four statistical procedures were employed to answer the proposed questions. Although principals\' overall ratings were higher, the findings indicated little disagreement between principals and media coordinators regarding the extent that schools met national standards. There was, however, a gap in theory and practice in North Carolina.\r\n\r\nResults showed few interdisciplinary teams/units; flexibility in scheduling, except in the media center; some teacher-based guidance programs; and little involvement of the media program in the instructional program. Close relationships were found between the extent to which national library media standards and essential middle school components were implemented.\r\n\r\nBased on the findings and conclusions of the study, recommendations were made to the state education agency, local schools, principals, media coordinators, teachers, and professional organizations.\r\n\r\nImplications of this study center on a need for better communication among key influential persons in middle schools so that the interrelatedness of various program areas will be recognized in order to improve teaching for learning.','School administration','Curricula','Teaching','0','9115590'),(673,'The role of learning resource services in selected community colleges','DT',1988,'Hisle, Wendell Leon, Jr.','Ph.D.','The University of Texas at Austin','','','','','','','','','','','','','United States','The University of Texas at Austin','United States','questionnaire ','','','http://login.ezproxy.library.ualberta.ca/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/303706401?accountid=14474','Community colleges have been redefining their role and function in higher education. Learning Resource Service (LRS) programs have been in a similar state of redefinition. This study, endorsed by the Joint Committee of the Association of College and Research Libraries of the American Library Association and the Association for Educational Communications and Technology, describes the present and emerging roles of selected American community college LRS programs. The data collected, along with interpretation and conclusions, was offered to the committee to support its work in developing new standards of service for LRS programs.\r\n\r\nColleges of the League for Innovation in the Community College were chosen as the sample for this study due to the League\'s national reputation for leadership in developing excellence in community college practices. Presidents, Vice-Presidents of Academic Affairs, and the Director/Dean of Learning Resource Services from twenty-six of the thirty-seven colleges (70 percent) chose to participate.\r\n\r\nRespondents were asked to complete a questionnaire which listed forty role statements for LRS programs. Responses regarding whether or not role presently existed in the LRS program at a college and whether or not the role would exist in the future provided the data for the study. The study also considered the impact of personal demographics, institutional demographics, communication patterns, and organizational structure on the level of agreement within and between respondent groups.\r\n\r\nAmong the findings of the study was that traditional LRS roles remain the most agreed upon within and between all respondent groups. No significant disagreement about LRS roles was found between Presidents and Vice-Presidents. Significant disagreement existed between Director/Deans and the other respondents primarily over roles related to instructional program involvement. Roles associated with the use of new technology showed the greatest changes in agreement from present to future. Organizational structure had significant impact on agreement between respondents regarding several future LRS roles.

Likewise, social factors and organizational features impact achievements and rewards of librarians. Thus, the objective of this study was to identify those variables influencing career advancement of librarians defined in terms of their promotions, tenure and earnings.\r\n\r\nThe National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM), the largest higher education system in Mexico, was the research setting. A self-administered questionnaire was delivered to 364 individuals having professional positions at UNAM libraries during Spring 1996. It was hypothesized that credential factors, bureaucratic factors, organizational and disciplinary achievements, academic culture factors, social ascribed factors, and institutional factors would explain differences in promotion, tenure, and earnings of librarians. Earnings was the main dependent variable; however, promotion and tenure status, and months for promotion and tenure were also tested as dependent variables.\r\n\r\nThe analysis was performed using linear and logistic regression. The results indicated that the probability of being tenured was related to participation in continuing education and departmental service assignments, having seniority, receipt of mentoring from senior librarians, being male, performing reference and public service activities, and being promoted. Being promoted was related to having high rank, participation in teaching activities, level of parent\'s education, and being tenured. The significant element influencing months to tenure was seniority. The determinants of months to promotion were seniority and professional association identification.\r\n\r\nThe variables that significantly contributed in explaining earnings variance among tenured librarians were level of studies completed, seniority, participation in teaching programs, and type of institution. Among promoted librarians, those variables that were significantly related to earnings were level of studies completed, seniority, participation in teaching programs, and type of institution.\r\n\r\nAlthough several variables dealing with academic profession and social aspects were significantly related to promotion, tenure and earnings, the results indicated that librarian rewards primarily answer to the bureaucratic paradigm of higher education institutions. Since librarians are part of the academic community, these results suggest the necessity of encouraging scholarly activities and a reward system in which those activities have more weight.','Library science','Higher education','School administration','0','9704915'),(675,'Organizational design in selected members of the Association of Research Libraries: An exploratory study of the matrix structure','DT',1995,'Mullaney, Beth Jo','Ph.D.','University of Pittsburgh','','','','','','','','','','','','','United States','University of Pittsburgh','United States','survey','questionnaire','interview','http://login.ezproxy.library.ualberta.ca/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/304235311?accountid=14474','This exploratory multiple case study investigated use of matrix design in selected United States members of the Association of Research Libraries. A questionnaire and interviews of top library managers from the four identified matrix libraries and their matched four hierarchically structured libraries were the data gathering techniques used.\r\n\r\nThe study was undertaken in part because library literature appeared to lack studies of organizational design in academic libraries. While there is much commentary on the wisdom of altering structures to better match academic library purpose, little research exists for library managers to consult when considering organizational structure. Much of the available commentary literature exhibits an influence from research conducted in fields such as business and sociology which in turn has suggested both that there is no one perfect organizational design, and that organizational design influences organizational effectiveness. The impact of information technology and the potential utility of this particular design for academic libraries provided additional impetus for the study. This work resulted in some findings that may be useful to library managers. Additionally it has generated a number of issues worthy of research consideration.\r\n\r\nFor matrix design libraries the findings included identification of three broad factor categories which may influence organizational design selections of library managers. They are: Library Staff, Technology and Economics. Within these three categories and the category Outside Environment eleven individual possible influencing factors were identified. The findings for hierarchically designed libraries included identification of a single broad factor category which may influence library managers\' organizational design selections, Technology. Hierarchical libraries identified five individual factors as possible influences within the Economics and Outside Environment categories as well, but according to the criteria of the study neither can be considered possible influencing factor categories. Therefore, Technology is the sole category common to both groups.\r\n\r\nObviously, this exploratory study cannot determine the potential of matrix design for large academic research libraries. However, it suggests a number of additional studies to conduct, some of which might result in more definitive findings about this structure\'s usefulness in this setting.','Library science','Management','School administration','0','9718624'),(676,'The administration of pupils\' use of the high school library','DT',1942,'Andersen, Roy Oliver','M.S.','University of Southern California','','','','','','','','','','','','','United States','University of Southern California','United States','-','','','http://login.ezproxy.library.ualberta.ca/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1621435307?accountid=14474','Not available.

Using case study methodology, evidence indicated that services provided by the centralized processing personnel may secure the integrity of an automated catalog, customize bibliographic records, and provide functional system databases for user access to media center holdings.

To examine these perceptions, a Library Assessment Survey was designed to assess coordination and administrator satisfaction relating to three of the four types of coordination examined. The survey, which was sent to 104 institutions, was also designed to indicate loose or tight organizational coupling with regard to the types of coordination.\r\n\r\nResults. Administrators from 68 institutions in 27 states responded to the survey. Data indicated that the administrators perceived: a moderate frequency of discussion with librarians; no formal responsibility for library services or resources; a moderate extent of centralization of influence over decisions about library services or resources; a moderate extent of match between their program missions and the manner in which library support was provided; little proficiency in their own use of off-campus library services; little knowledge about the types of off-campus library services used at other institutions; and, that library resources were highly valuable to their students. Data about administrator satisfaction were also reported, including that which indicated an overall moderate satisfaction rating for library support.\r\n\r\nConclusions. Among the study\'s conclusions were that external degree program administrators were satisficing (March & Simon, 1958) with regard to being highly satisfied with moderate levels of consistency between their program missions and the manner in which library support was provided for their programs.

Also, discussed were recommendations to librarians just joining the ACCESS PA project.\r\n\r\nThe researcher found that the quality of relationships that high school librarians had with their faculties and learners was an important factor in how successfully they implemented the ACCESS PA project. The quality of their relationships also effected how well they networked with other librarians in their consortiums. The opportunity to network with other librarians was of great help in the successful implementation of ACCESS PA. The ACCESS PA project expanded the resources available to the faculty and learners.

This study was limited to the perceptions of the library media specialists and library media administrators.\r\n\r\nTwo hundred twenty-six questionnaires were distributed to 202 media specialists and 24 library administrators, key stakeholders in the development and successful implementation of the bylaw. Statistical procedures such as frequency distributions, creation of outlier groups to perform two t-tests of independence on the means, chi-square tests, and correlations were used to analyze the data from 141 respondents or 62%.\r\n\r\nEight factors were identified that may account for the perceived level of implementation of the standards of media programs during the initial 4-year review cycle of the bylaw for school library media programs, COMAR 13A.05.04.01. The factors were clarity, implementation plans of the state and local education agencies, leadership, philosophies and policies, staffing, enrollment, and wealth.\r\n\r\nIt was concluded that five of the eight factors made a statistically significant difference on the implementation levels of the seven standards. Those respondents who held high perceptions about the five factors perceived the implementation levels to be high for the seven standards. The remaining three factors made a statistically significant difference on the implementation levels of selected standards.\r\n\r\nIt was further concluded that state policy had a chance of success if it was directly related to an existing program at the local level.

First, it identified factors which academic library support staff perceived as motivating them. Second, it examined relationships between those motivators and the demographic characteristics of academic library support staff.\r\n\r\nA combination of interview and survey was used to conduct the exploratory study of the support staff in a single large university library. Interviews of a random sample of the study population were conducted to determine what motivators academic library support staff reportedly valued. A survey administered to the study population required respondents to rate the value they placed on each of sixteen motivators on a seven point scale. Data analysis and hypotheses testing were done using Pearson product moment and point-biserial correlations and t-tests.\r\n\r\nSixteen motivators were identified and arranged in a ranked list based on the mean score of the values assigned each motivator by the respondents. The motivators \"using skills and abilities\" and \"intellectual challenge and stimulation\" ranked first and second respectively. Correlations between motivators valued and demographic attributes of the study population were generally weak. The t-tests revealed that in the population studied the demographic attributes enrollment in library science courses, length of time in current position, salary, location of job, and area of service were closely associated with certain motivators.\r\n\r\nThe results of the study provide information which may serve as a component in the development of management strategies to increase productivity and satisfaction of academic library support staff.

Demographic comparison with other academic librarians suggests participants may reflect a larger population.\r\n\r\nWork life content and context consists of tasks performed; technological and work systems; working conditions and securities; work setting; and beliefs, values, and preferences. The constant comparative method (grounded theory) was chosen because it allows (1) use of open-ended questions and face-to-face interactions for participant-driven data; (2) flexibility in data collection, coding, and analysis--necessary for identifying similarities, differences, and consistencies of meaning across emerging concepts; and (3) acknowledgement of the researcher\'s previous experience in similar work settings.\r\n\r\nFindings demonstrate that, as a group, these librarians engage in collection, catalog, reference, and learning-teaching-training work. Librarians define their work as \"primarily\" one of the first three; the fourth emerges from the data as a distinct kind of work. Librarians give greatest importance to primary work in a literal and conceptual sense. This work concept governs how they think, give order to each day, assign roles, determine the size of their work world, and define a sense of \"place\" and \"fit\" within life-at-work. In pictoral terms, librarians place primary work in the foreground, followed by colleagues. Less strongly depicted are library system-related matters (like policy, management, communication, loyalty, and responsibility); very few university images are visible.\r\n\r\nParticipants see academic librarianship as providing a professional identity associated with learning, teaching, and scholarship. They prefer as colleagues those who also approach work as thinkwork and puzzle-solving. They prefer users who learn to independently manipulate a library while working with librarians to master new information or knowledge-seeking techniques and resources. A service ideal operates, as does a sense of personal achievement in making things happen for themselves and users. Librarians believe they are most creative and do highest quality work when they control the various tasks that comprise work. Autonomy, variety, and choice are also highly valued elements in their work life.','Library science','Occupational psychology','School administration','0','9536813'),(690,'The role of the school library media specialist as perceived by selected Mississippi principals, classroom teachers, school library media specialists, and library media educators','DT',1989,'Bishop, Faira Lee','Ph.D.','The University of Southern Mississippi','','','','','','','','','','','','','United States','The University of Southern Mississippi','United States','questionnaire','one-way analysis of variance','Pearson product-moment correlation','http://login.ezproxy.library.ualberta.ca/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/303722243?accountid=14474','The role of the school library media specialist has changed over the last 20 years as a result of emerging technologies and changes in educational practice.

While previous studies have investigated certain aspects of student assistant employment in libraries, this study\'s observational design sought to gain an understanding of what student assistants do in the cultural context of the library.\r\n\r\nThis study was primarily based on an analysis of 144 hours of videotaped service activities occurring at one small college library\'s circulation desk during evening hours of a full academic term. This analysis resulted in a comprehensive taxonomy of 4,010 service encounters contextualized in the flow of the library\'s everyday activities. The videotaped data was supplemented by documentary material as well as in-depth interviews with ten key informants (student assistants and library users) providing the participants\' perspective on the service environment.\r\n\r\nThe service encounters in which student assistants and library users engaged were found to be largely low level, uncomplicated, clerical ones. But by their presence alone, however, student assistants were found to provide setting legibility and orientation to their peers. Depending on their motivation and training, student assistants were seen to competently provide a variety of services to library users.\r\n\r\nThe environmental influences on the manner in which services occurred were found to be closely related to the college\'s academic calender: the busiest recorded days coincided with midterm and final examination periods. The surrounding academic community\'s influence in the setting was also seen in instructor research requirements (resulting in a larger volume of service encounters) and in instructor familiarity with, and observance of, library procedures (e.g., allowing sufficient time for processing of library reserve items before sending students to the library for them, etc.).\r\n\r\nAmong the normative rules for behavior uncovered in this study were those perceived as competencies. Student assistants were perceived competent through their successful response to user requests, while library users were perceived competent largely through their ability to clearly articulate their service requests.\r\n\r\nThe findings suggested (1) additional and more intensive training for student assistants, (2) library user education, and (3) an overall expansion of student assistant participation in the service environment.','Higher education','School administration','Library science','0','9011151'),(692,'Correlation between transformational leadership practices of teachers and administrators of a large suburban newly established high school','DT',2011,'Garity, Thomas C.','Ed.D.','Lincoln Memorial University','','','','','','','','','','','','','United States','Lincoln Memorial University','United States','self-rating scale','observer scale','','http://login.ezproxy.library.ualberta.ca/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/925624618?accountid=14474','The purpose of the research study was to determine the correlation between transformational leadership practices of teachers and administrators of a large suburban newly established high school.

Demographic information was obtained to determine its relationship to both the self-rating and observer rating outcomes. The findings indicated a significant relationship between teachers LPI observer ratings of the five exemplary leadership practices of their administration with four of the exemplary leadership practices as reported by the teachers on the LPI self-rating scale.

Encouraging the heart, as rated by the self-rating scale, did not indicate a statistically significant relationship with the five exemplary leadership practices as rated by the observer scale. Gender was the only demographic variable that exhibited statistical significance in regards to any of the exemplary leadership practices as rated by the LPI self-rating scale or the LPI observer scale. The significance of the relationship between the self-rating scale and observer scale was that teachers perceived the success of their leadership practices as a derivative of the principals’ leadership styles.

Commonalities included commitment to increasing student access to technology and to building collections based on curriculum needs and student interests. Each library media center was marked with an invitational atmosphere enhanced with comfortable informal areas suitable for free reading and browsing. Student access, both before and after school in addition to during the school day, characterized the three library programs.

Conducted within the broad conceptual framework of a constructivist adaptation of learning theory, the study defines the “success” of students\' information seeking as it relates to their meaningful learning experience as a whole.\r\n\r\nIn order to study students\' information seeking as a meaningful learning experience, four foreshadowing questions were set out: (1) How do students initially understand information and information sources? (2) How do information structures of information sources affect students\' understanding about their topics? (3) What strategies do students use for restructuring information? and (4) How is students\' information use reflected in their products related to learning tasks?\r\n\r\nWithin the methodological framework of naturalistic inquiry, the study used a combination of concept maps and interviews as a unique method for investigating changes in students\' understanding based on their use of information. Twenty-one high school juniors in an honors class in persuasive speech were observed in their library media center while performing required learning tasks; eight of the students, their teacher, and the library media specialist were interviewed. Data were analyzed both manually and with the support of data management software.\r\n\r\nOverall, the findings suggest that students\' learning in an information-rich environment is dynamic and that students learn interactively and serendipitously. Several streams of analysis suggest more specific findings within these larger ones. To structure part of the analysis, Mayer\'s (1999) three processes for meaningful learning—selecting, organizing, and integrating—were extended to include two additional processes particularly important in information seeking: gathering and using. Findings suggest that all of these five processes are intertwined and dynamically related and the process of “using” information had a particular effect on students\' understanding about their topics as they created their final products. Additionally, four types of changes were identified as students conducted their information seeking and created their final products: simple, analytic, organizational, and holistic. Analyzed within the framework of the revised Bloom\'s Taxonomy of Educational Objectives (Anderson and Krathwohl, 2001), the data revealed that students\' learning progressed through all six levels of the taxonomy as they engaged with information.','Library science','Secondary education','','0','3094470'),(698,'Digital games for 21st century learning: Teacher librarians\' beliefs and practices','DT',2015,'Hovious, Amanda S.','M.S.','The University of North Dakota','','','','','','','','','','','','','United States','The University of North Dakota','United States','survey','descriptive statistics','','http://login.ezproxy.library.ualberta.ca/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1700356909?accountid=14474','Digital games as tools for learning in K–12 have been a topic of intense discussion over the last 15 years. One area of focus has been on the integration of commercial off-the-shelf games in lesson plans. A predictive factor for the adoption and integration of digital games is the attitudes or readiness of teachers. Yet, while many studies have examined this with teachers themselves, teacher librarians (TLs) have largely been ignored, despite the key role they play in education and technology adoption in schools. This study attempted to determine TLs’ beliefs and practices about digital games as 21st century learning tools, to examine similarities and differences with those of classroom teachers, and to see if and how TLs’ pedagogical beliefs impacted their perceptions of barriers toward digital game adoption. The Teachers’ Attitudes Toward Games (TATG) Survey measured TLs’ perceptions of barriers to using digital games. Findings suggest that TLs tended to use digital games to address discrete library skills—a behaviorist practice—despite the fact that they tended to hold constructivist pedagogical beliefs. Though, evidence showed that some were using games to integrate 21st century skills into classroom lessons. Similar to findings on classroom teachers, TLs perceived lack of time, lack of infrastructure, and lack of support as barriers to using digital games. Furthermore, TLs with behaviorist beliefs tended to perceive greater barriers to using digital games as compared to TLs with constructivist beliefs.','Library science','Educational technology','','0','1594168'),(699,'Technological strategic planning and globalization impact: Fine-tuning strategic planning methodology','DT',2008,'Miltenoff, Plamen','Ph.D.','The University of North Dakota','','','','','','','','','','','','','United States','The University of North Dakota','United States','comparison ','qualitative','quantitative','http://login.ezproxy.library.ualberta.ca/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/304549126?accountid=14474','Through this research, I sought to determine how technology leadership, as part of academic administration conducts strategic planning in educational technology.

The need for revision was based on a review of literature about strategic planning of education and technology in the United States and Europe, as well as research on globalization, education, and change.\r\n\r\nAn instrument, in Bulgarian and English, was distributed to students and faculty members from educational institutions in the United States and Bulgaria. Bulgaria was selected due to the following factors: the researcher is fluent in the language and has the local network, which facilitated and accelerated data gathering. More importantly, Bulgaria cannot be considered a part of the Western hemisphere and, thus, the homogeny of language and economy was avoided. On the other hand, Bulgaria does not fall in the category of developing countries lacking infrastructure or poorly developed educational system, which presented a feasible opportunity for meaningful comparison.\r\n\r\nA comparison of external data for SWOT analysis from a Midwestern University in the U.S. is compared with other American universities and with Bulgarian universities.

The researcher conducted observations and semi structured interviews to gain the perspectives of volunteers and librarians regarding the use of volunteers in school libraries. The collection of schedules, photographs, newsletters, and other artifacts enabled the researcher to create a description of three different library volunteer programs. This dissertation explores the motivations of volunteers who participate in volunteer programs, and describes the challenges of operating and maintaining library volunteer programs. Key findings emerged regarding the wishes of parent volunteers to develop authentic partnerships with school staff to engage students in meaningful student learning.

It identifies those bodies and organizations that have issued reports and promulgated and implemented policies, formal and de facto, regarding university libraries and analyzes their influence on each other and on the libraries, with particular emphasis on the libraries of the new universities.\r\n\r\nThe Universities Funding Council is the government advisory body; the Library Association, the Standing Conference of National and University Libraries, and the Committee of Vice-Chancellors and Principals are the primary professional organizations being examined.\r\n\r\nOf the eight new universities in England, the libraries of four are selected for concentrated examination: University of Essex, University of Sussex, University of Warwick, and University of Kent at Canterbury.','Library science','Higher education','Public administration','0','9333792'),(706,'Determining effective methods of funding library services in support of off-campus programs','DT',1989,'Van Blair, Betty A.','Ed.D.','University of Arkansas','','','','','','','','','','','','','United States','University of Arkansas','United States','interview','','','http://login.ezproxy.library.ualberta.ca/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/303665867?accountid=14474','An important development in higher education has been the expansion of off-campus and non-traditional programs. Library resources and services must be provided for the students enrolled in these off-campus courses. This research was undertaken to determine funding methods used to provide library services to off-campus students and faculty.\r\n\r\nThe population consisted of private, not-for-profit, baccalaureate degree granting institutions accredited by the North Central Association of Schools and Colleges. The study was designed to determine how well the institutions within the population met the Guidelines for Extended Campus Library Services of the Association of College and Research Libraries, as well as to investigate funding methods. Responses indicated that at least thirty-seven percent of the private, four-year, NCA accredited institutions have expanded their programming off-campus. Of these, however, approximately one-half involved the on-campus library in providing resources and services to the off-campus student.\r\n\r\nTwo statistically significant relationships were found when the on-campus library was involved with providing off-campus library services. The first was the involvement of the librarian in the planning process for off-campus programs, and the second was the provision of additional funding to provide these services. Four funding models were identified: (1) a larger general library budget, (2) assessment of a library fee to students enrolling in the off-campus program, (3) a percentage of the off-campus tuition or budget, and (4) bargaining for funding in consultation with the off-campus personnel.','Library science','Higher education','Adult education','0','9111157'),(707,'Transformational vs. transactional leadership in university libraries: A test of the model and its relationship to perceived library organizational effectiveness','DT',1993,'Albritton, Rosie Lee','Ph.D.','University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign','','','','','','','','','','','','','United States','University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign','United States','multivariate analysis','','','http://login.ezproxy.library.ualberta.ca/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/304031656?accountid=14474','Transformational vs. transactional leadership, as defined by Burns (1978), and Bass (1985), represents an important addition to previous conceptualizations of leadership. As technological and societal changes continue to influence libraries and higher education, leaders with vision and transformational characteristics will be needed in academic libraries to help encourage librarians and other staff to move towards individual renewal and organizational revitalization.\r\n\r\nThe objectives of this study were to determine: (1) whether perceptions of transformational factors (charisma, inspiration, intellectual stimulation, and individual consideration), as defined by the Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire (MLQ), (Bass, 1985; Bass & Avolio, 1990) would have incremental effects above and beyond transactional factors (contingent reward and management by exception), in medium-sized university libraries; (2) the relationship of the leadership factors to perceptions of three outcome measures from the MLQ: satisfaction, extra effort and effectiveness; and (3) the relationship of the MLQ model to perceived dimensions of library organizational effectiveness, as defined and measured by the Academic Library Effectiveness Questionnaire (ALEQ), (McDonald, 1987).\r\n\r\nAll hypotheses associating the transformational leadership model with organizational effectiveness in medium-sized university libraries were supported. The major findings indicated: perceptions of transformational and transactional leadership behaviors in the library sample were similar to the Bass (1985) model and other previous research on the model in other fields; transformational leadership behaviors were perceived by the library sample as having more influence (either direct or indirect) on leadership outcomes, than transactional leadership; library organizational effectiveness was perceived as a multidimensional construct, similar to the McDonald (1987) model; transformational leadership was perceived as having more influence (either direct or indirect), than transactional leadership on the predictability of dimensions of library organizational effectiveness, (i.e., planning, organizing, evaluating, managing and developing resources); and background, status, and other demographic characteristics of the respondents, (i.e., position in the library, faculty status, affiliation with privately or state-support institution, research or college library), had strong influences (direct and indirect) on perceptions of both transformational leadership and organizational effectiveness.\r\n\r\nResults of this study also provided validity data for both instruments and suggested the need to investigate other variables which might account for variance in leadership outcomes and organizational effectiveness.','Library science','Management','Occupational psychology','0','9328961'),(708,'The future role of the health sciences library in the Department of Veterans Affairs','DT',1991,'Wiesenthal, Diane','Ed.D.','Northern Arizona University','','','','','','','','','','','','','United States','Northern Arizona University','United States','questionnaire','','','http://login.ezproxy.library.ualberta.ca/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/303956788?accountid=14474','The collections, reference services and other activities of the 161 Department of Veterans Affairs Library Services located throughout the United States and Puerto Rico are designed to meet the specific needs of their user populations, i.e., staff, residents, students, and patients.

The population, 29 female academic library administrators holding directorships or assistant/associate library directorships of accredited graduate degree granting institutions in the states of Washington, Oregon, and Idaho, allowed a census study. From the 23 returned, completed questionnaires, 9 female administrators were selected for interviews.\r\n\r\nData from the questionnaires established that 91% of the population experienced one or more career-helping relationship(s). The interviews provide descriptive data in five categories.\r\n\r\nThe first category, Defining Mentoring, includes familiarity with the literature, defining mentoring, and labelling the relationship. Definitions were participant-provided and described a continuum of closeness, duration, and function.\r\n\r\nThe second category, Career Factors Relating to the Nature of the Mentoring Relationship, includes initiation of the relationship, duration of the relationship, career plan of the protege, and value of the relationship to the protege\'s career. The majority of the mentoring relationships were initiated by supervisors, occurred in the work place, and began before the protege had accepted her first administrative job. A second kind of mentoring, a group mentoring relationship, typically occurred at mid-career, after the librarian had taken her first administrative job.\r\n\r\nThe third category, Characteristics Which Promote Mentoring, includes characteristics in the mentor, characteristics in the protege, mentors on themselves as proteges, and characteristics in the situation. Personal and professional characteristics identified by interviewees to describe their mentors were very similar to characteristics which interviewees found in themselves as proteges and in their own proteges. These include ability, willingness to work, creativity, ethics, initiative, and intelligence.\r\n\r\nThe fourth category, What is Transmitted in Mentoring, includes love of profession and shared values, professional advancement, and administration techniques and philosophies. Of major importance in this category is emotional support.\r\n\r\nThe fifth category, Motivations and Methods of Mentoring, includes method of mentoring, motivation to mentor, leadership, and feminism. Collaborators employed a teaching/learning metaphor to describe their methods. They actively sought librarians with the potential for leadership in order to pass along professional values and philosophies.\r\n\r\nIn profile these women shared mutual respect and liking with their mentors and mentor groups.

This is especially true in science, where despite numerous calls in the LIS literature for more frequent and substantive collaboration between school librarians and science teachers, both parties struggle to see connections between their respective curricula.\r\n\r\nWhile a number of research studies have investigated the facilitators, process, and outcomes of teacher-librarian collaboration (TLC), including science-focused collaboration, in the context of K-12 schools, comparatively little attention has been paid to how classroom teachers and school librarians are taught about collaboration in their preservice education programs. The mixed methods, iterative, design-based study that is the focus of this dissertation addressed this gap by exploring the impact of a novel collaborative lesson plan project undertaken by students enrolled in an elementary science methods course and students enrolled in a graduate-level school library course.\r\n\r\nFindings indicate that preservice librarians deepened their understanding of TLC and the instructional role of the school librarian, the purpose and role of resources in the school library program, and the potential for school librarians to collaborate with science teachers. Preservice teacher participants reported high levels of motivation to participate in future TLC partnerships at the end of this project, despite the fact that there was little evidence to suggest deep shifts in these participants’ understanding of TLC and the instructional role of the school librarian over the course of the project. Activity theory provided a framework for identifying and discussing five tensions experienced by participants as their learning was mediated by the classroom and community context, tools, and each other.\r\n\r\nProject outcomes include a set of design guidelines that can help teacher and school librarian educators implement similar assignments in their own contexts, a synthesized model of the TLC process as experienced by project participants, and a new proposed model of TLC that reflects participants’ understandings of the various forms that TLC might take in practice and the factors that contribute to the overall intensity of collaborative partnerships.','Library science','Education','','0','10119809'),(711,'ISO 9000 implementation in Thai academic libraries','DT',2001,'Praditteera, Malivan','Ed.D.','University of Pittsburgh','','','','','','','','','','','','','United States','University of Pittsburgh','United States','Questionnaires ','interviews ','','http://login.ezproxy.library.ualberta.ca/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/304723695?accountid=14474','This study examined quality assurance models currently used in 54 Thai academic libraries under the supervision of Thailand\'s Ministry of University Affairs. Questionnaires were completed by all academic libraries and cases studies prepared based on this information and interviews conducted at four ISO 9000 certified academic libraries to investigate the ISO 9000 implementation and certification process. Factors that facilitated and hindered the ISO 9000 implementation process were investigated. Additionally, the benefits and challenges of the ISO 9000 implementation process were examined from the perspectives of the senior librarians.\r\n\r\nThe results indicated that several quality assurance approaches had been utilized in Thai academic libraries: a self-accreditation approach, ISO 9000 model, the Ministry of University Affairs model, Total Quality Management, benchmarking and a self-developed model. Twenty libraries had implemented quality assurance approaches and most other Thai academic libraries were planning to develop and implement quality assurance systems/approaches in the future. The most popular choice was ISO 9000. Eight Thai academic libraries were utilizing ISO 9000, and four of them received ISO 9002 certification.\r\n\r\nThe most important reasons for choosing ISO 9002 as quality assurance model in Thai academic libraries were to standardize and to improve library service quality. Funding support, high level of commitment, and the attitude of administrators were perceived as critical factors affecting the success of ISO 9002 implementation. Whereas high costs, documentation work, excess time demands, and a lack of ISO 9002 training were perceived as major obstacles.\r\n\r\nThe accountability to their parent institutions, promoting a good image, improving services, and increasing quality awareness of library personnel were important benefits from ISO 9002 certification. Good business practices; evaluation tools; elimination of duplication of activities; creating a formal training system; and employee involvement and participation were perceived as the strength of ISO 9002. On the other hand, the perceived challenge in addition to the obstacles to implementation was the difficulty in adapting the generic ISO 9000 system requirement to library work.\r\n\r\nISO 9002 (1994 version) was indicated as suitable for academic libraries. However, the question of whether ISO 9000 is the best fit for academic libraries in pursuing and assuring quality has yet to be satisfactorily answered.\r\n\r\nThe road to quality for Thai academic libraries has not ended. There are still other business quality assurance models that Thai academic libraries are interested in implementing, such as TQM, and benchmarking. Regardless of the models, this indicates that academic libraries in Thailand are eager to pursue quality in their libraries.','Higher education','School administration','Library science','0','3038269'),(712,'The development and utilization of an online instrument to assess the quality of K–12 elementary school libraries','DT',2006,'Beyer, Evelyn L.','Ed.D.','University of Houston','','','','','','','','','','','','','United States','University of Houston','United States','survey','','','http://login.ezproxy.library.ualberta.ca/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/305325599?accountid=14474','The 1997 School Library Programs: Standards and Guidelines for Texas defines five Components for a model school library program: (1) Learning Environment; (2) Curriculum Integration; (3) Resources; (4) Program Management; and (5) Facilities. In 2000, the Texas Library Standards Online Assessment Instrument (LSOAI) was developed as a multi-user web-based instrument for assessing K--12 school library programs. The developers promoted the online instrument as a way in which librarians, and other stakeholders, could easily access library evaluation data on the Texas school library programs.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this study is to assess the quality of Texas elementary library programs by examining librarians\' ratings on the LSOAI for 2001--2002. This study also investigates how these ratings relate to student achievement as demonstrated by (a) student Texas Assessment of Academic Skills (TARS) reading scores, (b) school Academic Excellence Indicator System (AEIS) ratings, and (c) school demographics. Furthermore, an analysis of the reliability and validity of the LSOAI is carried out in order to determine the usability of the LSOAI as an instrument for assessing K--12 libraries.\r\n\r\nThe present study is based upon a secondary data analysis of a convenience sample of 256 Texas elementary librarians who completed the LSOAI in 2001--2002. The results indicate that the LSOAI is both a reliable and valid instrument for accessing school library programs. The findings also reveal that Exemplary rated libraries have lower student-teacher ratios, lower percentages of economically disadvantaged and LEP populations, smaller budgets for instruction and instructional leadership, and greater access to the Internet and its resources than lower rated libraries. Internet access has a high, positive association with the five Components of the 1997 Standards.

It examined the occupational role identity and the occupational role image of female librarians in each of four traditional librarian subspecialties. These subspecialties were academic, public, school, and special librarianship.\r\n\r\nOccupational role identity was assessed by a national survey of 826 librarians representing equally the four subspecialties. Intraprofessional heterogeneity among these subspecialties was predicted to occur on social background, orientation to the occupational role, and sex-role variables. The illusion of heterogeneity may be created by the situation-specificity of the subspecialties and a general autonomy. Low magnitude differences occurred. Reasons for the overall homogeneity included the associational sample, the identification of the librarian counter-role as \"service receiver\" rather than a specific patron type, and the idea that only one occupational identity for the librarian may exist.\r\n\r\nThe Occupational Outlook Handbook identified three ways of categorizing librarians--by function (user or technical services), by type of library in which employed, and by the economic relationship to the host institution (instructional or business). Multiple discriminant function analysis on selected key variables yielded a fourth categorization of librarian--by the relationship to the profession. Three relationships were examined: Conventional, Contributing, and Contemporary Librarian. Freidson\'s zones of autonomy and Johnson\'s continuum of control were used to analyze these librarian categories.\r\n\r\nGenerally, the librarians were satisfied with their careers (except for the pay) and had excellent occupational self images. However, the occupational image of the librarian presented from within the occupation was shallow. Occupational role image was assessed by a content analysis of 8600 product/service advertisements in four related library publications from 1967-1986. Only 101 librarians were portrayed; fifty percent were engaged in computer searching. The professional associations whose role it is, in part, to disseminate the occupational culture and to buffer the occupation from outside forces, were criticized for not enhancing the approved typifications of librarians in their publications and for not bringing the occupational role image portrayed in the advertisements into alignment with the occupational role identity of the practitioners.','Sociology','Library science','','0','9010505'),(714,'An investigation of preferences for activities performed by media specialists in middle school','DT',2007,'Pratschler, Leslie','Ed.D.','University of West Georgia','','','','','','','','','','','','','United States','University of West Georgia','United States','focus group','survey','','http://login.ezproxy.library.ualberta.ca/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/304779186?accountid=14474','This investigation explored the preferences that middle school personnel hold regarding activities performed by school library media specialists, with an expectation toward finding avenues to increase collaboration.

Specific activities within each of the broad categories were identified from the literature and from a focus group of active media specialists. Respondents included middle school personnel within one large suburban school district south of Atlanta who were surveyed online and asked to rank the activities in each broad category according to how they believed media specialists should devote their time and efforts. Results indicated that the program administration and management category was preferred by most of the respondents, with the activity of ordering appropriate materials seen as the most important within that category. Surveys were also analyzed according to the employment position of each respondent in the school community: classroom teacher, administrator, counselor, other school personnel, and media specialist. Findings suggested that classroom teachers possessed similar beliefs to school administrators. Few school counselors returned the survey which led the researcher to conclude that more needs to be done to establish a working relationship with the counseling department within the schools.

The story, selected as the stimulus material, came from traditional Native American folklore, was positively reviewed in major journals, and was included on recommended professional booklists. The response instrument used in the study facilitated two different types of response. In the first segment, students cast a vote in order to express their likes and dislikes. In the second segment of free response, students were allowed opportunity for reflection in order to express what they determined was worth saying. Students\' free responses were coded using Squire\'s (1964) classification system with its seven major categories. The researcher designated labels within categories concerning plot, characterization, theme, meaning, questioning, visual imagery, author\'s use of language, and author\'s style. Because of the nature of storytelling, a subcategory dealing with responses which demonstrated reaction to the storyteller or the storyteller\'s style was included. In addition, responses were analyzed according to gender preferences.\r\n\r\nThe fourth grade students in this study revealed that the delivery systems for story impacted their responses. More students in the Independent Reading Treatment Group voted that they “did not like” or “really did not like” the story. For teachers and parents who wish to develop positive responses to literature, then the findings of this study indicate that using the oral delivery systems of read-alouds and storytelling provoke more positive responses, regardless of gender, than does independent reading. Students in the Read Aloud Treatment Group made more interpretational responses. More free responses came from the storytelling group which was the smallest, indicating that storytelling as a mode of delivery may generate more conversation about literature than reading independently or hearing a story read aloud.','Library science','Literacy','Reading instruction','0','3059173'),(716,'Relationships among student access to technology, district per pupil expenditures, and ACT scores','DT',1992,'Young, Carolyn Kay','Ed.Spec.','Central Missouri State University','','','','','','','','','','','','','United States','Central Missouri State University','United States','correlation statistics','','','http://login.ezproxy.library.ualberta.ca/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/304023403?accountid=14474','The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between technology in schools and achievement of seniors by investigating access to technology, district per pupil expenditures, and scores of seniors on the American College Test (ACT).

The population for this study included library administrators employed in 145 public institutions defined by the Carnegie Commission as Masters I and Masters II. The design of this study was correlational using correlational and survey methods. The research instruments consisted of the Power Perception Profile - Profile of Self developed by Hersey and Natemeyer (1979) and the Empowerment-Readiness Survey developed by Henkel, Repp-Begin, and Vogt (1993), a demographic survey of the library administrator. The objectives of this study were to answer two questions: (1) Is there a significant relationship among library administrators\' preferred power use, their readiness to empower, and administrators\' characteristics? (2) Is there a significant relationship between library administrators\' preferred use of the seven bases of power and the six dimensions of empowerment?\r\n\r\nResults. The results obtained through the three instruments did not support a general relationship existing between administrators\' preferred power use, empowerment, and selective administrators\' characteristics.\r\n\r\nConclusions. Administrators preferred to use expert power. However, male administrators showed no relationship between the seven individual power bases and the six dimensions of empowerment. Female administrators did show mild relationships between their preferred base of expert power and the six dimensions of empowerment.

A linear programming-based technique called Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) is used to identify those libraries which are capable of producing higher levels of output using lower levels of input at various stages of the production process, and to estimate the extent to which production potential is underrealized in comparatively inefficient libraries.\r\n\r\nDEA is applied to the evaluation of data gathered by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) and the California Department of Education in 1985-86. Eight library resources were designated inputs; ten library service options and three measures of library use were designated intermediate outputs; and three measures of student achievement were designated final outputs. The sample consists of 74 elementary school libraries, drawn from among the NCES survey\'s California respondents and placed in one of four expenditure level groups.\r\n\r\nUnlike most previous applications of DEA, this study focuses on irregularities in score and variable distributions produced by the model under various conditions. The results of these explorations suggest, in part, that: (1) efficiency status varies considerably across stages and expenditure levels; (2) managerially efficient libraries differ from managerially inefficient libraries, in that they employ more certified and fewer noncertified staff, add fewer books and have smaller collections, offer more service options in the area of provision of information than in the area of resource-based instruction, and appear to emphasize library attendance over both circulation and participation in library skills instruction; and (3) there are few differences in variable distribution between efficient and inefficient libraries when the program effects of expenditure level are factored in; program efficient libraries also differ from managerially efficient libraries, in that they tend to employ more volunteers and have larger collections.\r\n\r\nThis study is directed at policy analysts and administrative decision-makers, wishing to determine whether school libraries can be differentiated on the basis of an efficient choice criterion; at school library researchers, interested in the mechanics of model development; and at practicing school librarians, challenged to show how the efficient management of library resources might impact upon the attainment of school-related outcomes.','Library science','Operations research','Economics','0','9330528'),(720,'Library participation in the problem-based learning curricula of medical schools: Perceptions of library directors and medical school administrator-educators','DT',1996,'Ginn, David Steven','Ph.D.','University of Pittsburgh','','','','','','','','','','','','','United States','University of Pittsburgh','United States','statistical analysis','comparison ','survey ','http://login.ezproxy.library.ualberta.ca/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/304258708?accountid=14474','In the past decade, a growing number of medical schools have revised their curricula to emphasize problem-based learning (PBL). Medical Librarians have responded to this shift in curricula and the resulting need for information, by developing programs and strategies to support PBL-related information needs.\r\n\r\nThis study investigated the extent and nature of medical library involvement in PBL and the perceptions of that involvement by Administrator-Educators and Library Directors. Library Directors and Administrator-Educators at U.S. and Canadian academic medical centers were surveyed to assess library involvement in PBL, knowledge of involvement, and the relationship between involvement and perception. The survey was also designed to identify important information resources and the key individuals having the greatest impact on library involvement. Study design and methodology allowed for the statistical analysis and comparison of responses from three groups: Librarians, Administrator-Educators, and Librarians and Administrator-Educators (matched pairs) from the same institution.\r\n\r\nStudy results demonstrated a range of involvement by Medical Librarians in the PBL curricula of their schools. Analysis of matched pairs from the same institution indicated that overall assessment, or knowledge of library involvement in PBL, was lower for Administrator-Educators. Perception of library involvement and role was rated moderate to very high by both groups, however Librarians were significantly more likely to consider that PBL involvement had enhanced the image of the library or the Librarian. Faculty Facilitators were identified by both groups as the most important information resource, while the Librarian\'s teaching role was considered more important by Librarians. The study identified Course Directors and Associate Deans as having the greatest effect on library involvement and being the preferred choices as contact people with whom to discuss PBL. The study suggests that an opportunity exists for Administrator-Educators to have greater knowledge of Librarians\' involvement in the PBL curriculum. Administrator-Educators perceive that library involvement in PBL has had a positive impact, however Librarians\' perception of positive impact is greater.','Library science','Health education','School administration','0','9709426'),(721,'Documenting school life: Formal and informal imprints of a fifth-grade classroom','DT',2004,'Trace, Ciaran','Ph.D.','University of California, Los Angeles','','','','','','','','','','','','','United States','University of California, Los Angeles','United States','Ethnographic method','','','http://login.ezproxy.library.ualberta.ca/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/305218074?accountid=14474','Recorded information—records, documents, paperwork—is a pervasive part of any school environment. Records are created and accumulated by teachers, administrators, and students as they go about their daily lives. In this dissertation study I examine how and why one class of fifth grade students create and use records, and what function these records play within the elementary school.\r\n\r\nThis research views school records as social entities and, as such, seeks to understand how records are produced, maintained, and used in socially organized ways. Ethnographic methods as well as questions drawn from the micro-sociological approach of ethnomethodology are used to understand (1) what is going on in the classroom with regard to record creation and use, (2) what students have to know (individually and collectively) to create, maintain, and read records in a school context, and (3) what the record embodies and achieves in this social setting.\r\n\r\nThe research findings are centered on the ethnomethodological concept of membership and as such are predicated on the notion that “being a student is a job.” The first findings chapter uncovers the stock of knowledge, which students were learning as part of the “hidden curriculum,” that dealt in some way with record creation and use. This chapter also looks at how the processes of record creation and use can be understood from an ethnomethodological perspective. The second findings chapter draws from both naturalistic and ethnomethodological notions about both the existence and the purposes behind the informal aspects of organizational life. This chapter focuses on what students can achieve of their own volition outside of the formal rules structure of the classroom. In particular, the focus is on what students achieved through the creation and use of what are referred to as unofficial or informal literacies.','Library science','Information Systems','Elementary education','0','3142537'),(722,'Centrality and the academic library','DT',1993,'Grimes, Deborah Jeanne','Ph.D.','The University of Alabama','','','','','','','','','','','','','United States','The University of Alabama','United States','modified grounded theory','interview ','','http://login.ezproxy.library.ualberta.ca/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/304044825?accountid=14474','The purpose of this research project was to study academic library centrality within the context of organization theory and to identify possible indicators of the concept on which further study may be based. The concept is related to \"the library is the heart of the university\" metaphor and to the mission of the academic library. Using a modified grounded theory methodology, the research design of this study included: (1) clarification of the concepts of resource allocation, retrenchment, power, and centrality; (2) a pilot study and development of interview format and questions; and (3) a formal study with interviews of chief academic officers and chief executive officers in five universities. Conclusions drawn from this study are: (1) the metaphor is not equivalent to the academic library mission, and its continued use has negative implications for both theory development and practice; and (2) important components of two existing definitions of academic unit centrality are relevant to the academic library, but neither is directly applicable. In addition, a number propositions arise from the study: (1) certain indicators of academic subunit centrality identified in previous studies are not indicative of academic library centrality; (2) certain services, resources, or facilities provided by the academic library are relevant indicators of academic library centrality in relation to the general mission of the university; (3) certain indicators are more pertinent to the university mission component of teaching while others are more pertinent to the component of research; (4) three major categories of indicators of academic library can be distilled from the range of possibilities: service, access, tradition; (5) these broad categories may be applied as empirical indicators of academic library centrality, regardless of mission component, university priorities, or type of academic institution; and (6) academic library centrality can be operationally defined as user success.','Library science','Information Systems','Higher education','0','9325198'),(723,'A Comparison of the Effects of Library Book Selection Methods on the Level of Motivation for Reading and Comprehension Skills of Second Grade Students','DT',2011,'Bonaria, Amy','M.Ed.','The William Paterson University of New Jersey','','','','','','','','','','','','','United States','The William Paterson University of New Jersey','United States','ANOVAs','T-tests','surveys','http://login.ezproxy.library.ualberta.ca/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/901099501?accountid=14474','Common teaching practices in elementary schools focus much attention on students developing strong reading comprehension skills in the early grades. This selection emphasizes the importance of second grade students becoming competent, independent readers who both understand and enjoy the texts they read. Selecting and using the most effective method by which students are allowed to choose their books plays an essential part in developing strong comprehension skills and a love of reading.\r\n\r\nThe overarching goal of this study was to determine what library book selection method would best enhance student motivation for reading and reading comprehension skills. This study was particularly conducted to examine the differences in motivation levels and comprehension skills among students who had been allowed to choose books that matched their interests, books that matched both their interests and reading levels, and books that had not been specifically matched to their interests or reading levels. This study also examined the amount of enjoyment the students experienced while reading their chosen books. The participants were second grade students that composed 3 classes that visited the media center on a specific day during the related arts cycle period at their school. Each group was assigned a condition, and each group was given a set of preselected books to choose from that the teacher-researcher had chosen for them that matched their interests, their interests and reading levels, or did not specifically match either. Their experiences helped show which method was the most effective in raising the students\' motivation for reading, comprehension skills, and enjoyment while working their chosen books.\r\n\r\nData taken during this study were analyzed using ANOVAs and T-tests. Motivation levels were assessed using pre- and post-intervention motivation surveys. The results were compared to determine if one particular group showed a greater increase in reading motivation as a result of the intervention. A comprehension and engagement assessment was also given to each student following the intervention period. The results of the assessments were examined to find out if one group showed a stronger level of comprehension or enjoyment in their chosen books.\r\n\r\nThe results of this study indicated that there was a trend towards students whose books were not a specific match for their interests demonstrating higher levels of motivation for reading. There was also a trend towards higher scores on the reading comprehension assessment for students whose books had been matched to their interests rather than students whose books were not a match for their interests. In addition, there was a trend towards the students whose books only matched their interests attaining higher scores on the comprehension assessment. Finally, there was a trend towards the students whose books only matched their interests showing higher levels of enjoyment in their chosen books.\r\n\r\nImplications with this study in regards to future educational practices in research and classrooms include longer, more intense intervention periods with smaller groups of students. Future research still needs to be carried out to provide further insight into the effectiveness of the different library book selection methods to improve the level of motivation for reading and the quality and strength of reading comprehension skills in second grade students.','Library science','Literacy','Reading instruction','0','1500575'),(724,'So you want to launch a satellite: A practical guide to the development of a community college off -campus location','DT',2004,'Huffman, Dennis E.','D.A.C.C.E.','George Mason University','','','','','','','','','','','','','United States','George Mason University','United States','survey','','','http://login.ezproxy.library.ualberta.ca/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/305049038?accountid=14474','This dissertation is a case study documenting the opening and first three years of operation of Prince George\'s Community College at University Town Center, an off-campus center located in Hyattsville, Maryland. Five broad areas, corresponding to selected functional areas of the College\'s five vice presidents, are covered: facilities, instruction, student services, technology, and continuing education. Within each of these areas, the author explores operational issues encountered during the first three years of the Center\'s existence.\r\n\r\nThe facilities chapter addresses such issues as parking, security, custodial services, and procurement. The challenges faced at the Center are outlined, as are the strategies adopted for addressing them.\r\n\r\nInstruction is presented in four parts—scheduling classes, staffing instruction, sustaining instructors, and providing academic support. The scheduling section provides insight into the development of the Center\'s first schedule and factors affecting subsequent schedules, particularly with regard to maximizing enrollment and space usage. The discussion includes issues related to full- and part-time faculty and examines reasons for the heavy reliance of off-campus centers on adjunct faculty. Implications, both from a policy perspective and from an instructional perspective, are presented, including strategies for faculty orientation and the dynamic of how the functions of the respective academic departments are represented and carried out by off-campus staff. This section concludes with an examination of tutoring, off-campus library services, and other systems for supporting learning.\r\n\r\nThe Student Services section focuses on ways in which a broad range of functions can be represented off campus by a small staff. Recruitment, admissions, testing, orientation, advising, cashier functions, financial aid and college life services are each discussed, as well as strategies for managing the front counter.\r\n\r\nTechnology issues are presented as well, including connectivity and hardware concerns, software issues (particularly with regard to licenses), and facility design and staffing. The section concludes with a discussion of the Workforce Development and Continuing Education division.

The widespread availability of cataloging networks, library budget reductions, technological innovations in libraries, and cataloging educational concerns have influenced the library profession during the past decade.\r\n\r\nIn order to make knowledgeable decisions concerning technical services operations and budgets, the tasks performed, the levels of decisions made, and the amount of participation in decision-making by technical services managers and catalogers must be addressed. There is insufficient empirical data documenting these variables.\r\n\r\nTwenty-nine technical services managers and catalogers from seven academic libraries that support institutions with student enrollments between 10,000 and 15,000 participated in this study. They completed amount of participation in decision-making and job satisfaction scales, and documented the tasks they performed and the time spent on each task and submitted original cataloging records created during a four-week period.\r\n\r\nThe tasks were categorized within three decision levels: (1) restricted discretion; (2) moderate discretion; and (3) extensive discretion. Non-parametric tests were computed to test for associations between the demographics of the technical services managers and catalogers and the amount of participation in decision-making; the levels of decisions; the quality of the bibliographic record, production volume, and job satisfaction. Tests were also computed for associations between amount of participation in decision-making and the level of decisions and quality of the bibliographic record, production volume, and job satisfaction. Descriptives and frequencies were also calculated for each variable.\r\n\r\nThe MLS and the level in the organizational hierarchy are positively associated with the amount of participation in decision-making, level of decisions, production volume, and job satisfaction. There is also a negative association between level in the organizational hierarchy and descriptive cataloging errors.\r\n\r\nImplications for educating future catalogers are discussed. Scales for measuring the amount of participation in decision-making and job satisfaction; logs for documenting tasks; and measures for documenting production volume and evaluating the bibliographic record are included.','Library science','Public administration','School administration','0','9306398'),(726,'A study of the community college libraries in Wyoming','DT',1967,'Andersen, James D.','Ed.D.','University of Wyoming','','','','','','','','','','','','','United States','University of Wyoming','United States','-','','','http://login.ezproxy.library.ualberta.ca/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/302300285?accountid=14474','Not available.

This study helped me eliminate those barriers and build a model for collaboration at Ayden Middle School. First, I had to explore Ayden Middle school’s perspective on collaboration. In order to do this, I interviewed the principal, interviewed and surveyed the teachers and surveyed the students. To determine the principal’s perception of collaboration, and how he would rate the collaboration between the teachers and media specialist, I discussed the Loertscher Taxonomy scale with him. I also wanted to know what the teachers perceived as a barrier to collaboration. The teachers rated the collaboration between themselves and the media specialist using the Loertscher Taxonomy Scale. Some teachers seldom collaborated with the media specialist, and I wanted to determine what barriers to collaboration they perceived. I also wanted to find out how often the teachers collaborated with the media specialist and what effect this collaboration experience had on students’ grades. The students were given a survey using Google docs in which they were asked questions about several aspects of the media center and about the media specialist. This gave me the students’ perspective about the media center, and my role as a media specialist. In my investigation, I found one of the major concerns for teachers was time. They all felt they needed more time to collaborate with the media specialist. They also believe the county needs to hire a technology facilitator and a full time media assistant for Ayden Middle School. They believe this will give the media specialist time to collaborate and plan lessons with the teachers.','Library science','Middle School education','Educational technology','0','1507104'),(728,'New models for research libraries in the digital age','DT',2006,'Halbert, Martin','Ph.D.','Emory University','','','','','','','','','','','','','United States','Emory University','United States','case study','metadata ','','http://login.ezproxy.library.ualberta.ca/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/304942491?accountid=14474','A dissertation presented on new models for digital service by research libraries.

The study was also designed to forecast significant trends in academic libraries that represent serious challenges or change in the conduct of academic library services, processes and programs.\r\n\r\nA panel of experts from the library profession was selected to participate in a Delphi panel to determine the importance of a list of critical processes and performance measures relevant to measuring quality in academic libraries. Panel members were identified by their record of publication on continuous quality improvement in libraries or through a recommendation of the staff at the Association of Research Libraries. The processes and performance measures were identified through a review of the literature and in consultation with a review panel from the Association of Research Libraries\' Office of Leadership and Management Services. An instrument, with clear instructions, was developed to permit the panel members to score the level of importance of each critical process and performance measure. This instrument was structured using the Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award\'s seven categories. Two rounds were conducted to determine a consensus of opinion of the panel on the importance of each critical process, performance measure, and prediction made by the panelists, and on the likelihood of occurrence of each prediction.\r\n\r\nThe results of the study showed that a student, faculty and stakeholder focus was the most important aspect of a continuous quality improvement program.

The study investigated the extent to which secondary school principals\' assessment of the school library program\'s role and the teacher-librarian\'s role as defined in the Pennsylvania Standards for Library Certification and Practice converged or diverged from that of secondary teacher-librarians\' assessment. Additionally, the study sought to ascertain secondary principals\' and secondary teacher-librarians\' assessment regarding the implementation of information literacy into the school\'s curriculum. The study provided both a descriptive and an inferential analysis of school library programs and teacher-librarians. The Statistical Package for the Social Sciences was used to analyze the data collected from the survey questionnaires. The probability for all tests of significance was set at .05. The study\'s major finding was that principals indicated the major role of teacher-librarians was in reference and research services, while teacher-librarians indicated their major role was instruction in information literacy; Other findings demonstrated: (1) the means for teacher-librarians were significantly higher than the means for principals on the following five library services: collection development and organization, integration of information with curricular content, reading guidance, staff development and training; and policy development; (2) there was a high degree of consistency between the rankings of specific library services from both groups (.864); (3) there was no significant difference in the quality of communication between principals and teacher-librarians; (4) both principals and teacher-librarians agreed that the primary challenge that faced the library program was lack of money; (5) both principals and teacher-librarians indicated increased staff development was needed to integrate information literacy into the curriculum; (6) principals named lack of funding as the major barrier to the implementing and integrating information literacy into the curriculum, while teacher-librarians named negative teacher attitudes and a lack of understanding of the role of the teacher-librarian as an instructional partner as major barriers.

Literature on library department chairs has traditionally focused on supervisory and/or management issues. The main focus of the library leadership literature has been deans or directors. Roles of chairs of postsecondary teaching departments have been researched for many years. Academic library faculty differ from teaching department faculty in that: nearly two thirds are female; they enter the profession at an older average age; are employed on a twelve month basis, while being required to meet criteria for a successful bid for tenure and/or promotion; and their accepted terminal degree is a Masters degree from a program accredited by the American Library Association.\r\n\r\nQuestions addressed were: (1) What institutional characteristics, (2) chair characteristics, and (3) library faculty demographic characteristics significantly effect library faculty perceptions of the chair\'s (a) activities to enhance faculty development, and (b) leadership practices? Non-administrative faculty in the libraries of research universities in the United States completed a survey instrument consisting of three parts: (1) a demographics section; (2) a researcher-developed survey of faculty perceptions of the department chairs\' role in faculty development; and (3) the Leadership Practices Inventory - Observer (LPI-O).\r\n\r\nSignificant factors in library faculty perceptions of the chair\'s leadership practices were chair\'s location prior to promotion, faculty member\'s number of years at the institution, and faculty member\'s education completed. None of the characteristics considered were significant factors in library faculty\'s perceptions of the chair\'s faculty development activities. Ratings of the department chairs\' use of activities to enhance faculty development were extremely moderate. The ranking of items on both instruments suggests library faculty consider themselves primarily responsible for their own professional growth and development. The top-ranked leadership practices categories were “enabling others to act” and “modeling the way”.

Although school library media specialists (LMSs) have struggled to negotiate their identities in public K12 education for decades, this “identity crisis” seems to have reached a critical point due to changes in U.S. learning environments brought about by federal legislation, the implementation of standards-based teaching, the emphasis on standardized criterion referenced testing, and the proliferation and ubiquitous use of computers and the Internet as information sources. Although teacher identity has been thoroughly studied, the ways in which LMSs describe themselves in their professional role and how their identities change from pre-service to in-service are rarely investigated. Using Holland, Lachicotte, Skinner, and Cain’s (1998) theory of identity and their concept of figured worlds as a framework, this study explores how four novice LMSs negotiated the identities made available to them in the figured worlds of their public K12 school environments.\r\n\r\nThe following questions guided the study: 1. How do novice library media specialists describe their professional identities? a. How does personal history inform the construction of professional identity of novice library media specialists? b. How do novice library media specialists negotiate identity within the figured worlds of public K12 schools?\r\n\r\nThe four participants were first year LMSs recruited from a large urban school district in the southeastern United States. Data collection took place over the course of the 2011-2012 school year and included in-depth interviews, document analysis, journal responses, and observations. Findings indicate that the figured worlds in which novice library media practitioners begin their careers are often shaped by the experiences that faculty, administrators, and students have had with previous LMSs and bear significant influence on the identities afforded new LMSs as well as their own experiences with LMSs prior to their preparation programs.','Library science','Teacher education','','0','3571380'),(735,'Bibliotherapy for Adopted Children: A Pathway to Healthier Adoptive Identity and Self-Esteem','DT',2012,'Myers, Carolyn D.','M.A.','Prescott College','','','','','','','','','','','','','United States','Prescott College','United States','qualitative ','','','http://login.ezproxy.library.ualberta.ca/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1021033866?accountid=14474','A qualitative study on bibliotherapy and how it can be utilized as a tool to help adopted children improve their self-esteem and understanding of their own adoptive identity.

Criteria for participation were: (a) Iowa school districts where enrollment exceeded 3,000 and a district-level library media coordinator was employed; (b) a library media specialist served full-time in one school; (c) a library media specialist was recommended by the district coordinator, based on acknowledgement that, given the situation, the library media specialist would be re-hired based on acceptable performance.\r\n\r\nLibrary media specialists and fifth-grade teachers in their respective schools were classified as employing either a fixed or a flexible library media instruction schedule. Questionnaires completed by library media specialists and teachers indicated curriculum involvement and library skills integration for a six-week period. Each participant listed instructional units in which the library media specialist had participated and categorized participation as: gathering materials, identifying objectives, planning activities, teaching, and/or evaluating the unit. For each unit, participants identified the content area and stated whether the library media specialist taught library skills for the unit.\r\n\r\nThe findings of the study were: (1) Library media specialists in flexible scheduling settings were more likely to evaluate instructional units with teachers, but there were no statistically significant differences between fixed and flexible schedule groups in the other four curriculum involvement activities investigated in the study. (2) Schedule and teachers\' planning style interacted in a statistically significant manner to produce more curriculum involvement in each of the five curriculum involvement areas when flexible scheduling and team planning were implemented together. (3) The most frequent curriculum involvement occurred in reading/language arts. (4) Recency of degree, years of experience as a teacher or as a library media specialist, membership in professional organizations, and planning style of teachers (team versus individual planning), showed no statistically significant relationship to either curriculum involvement or skills integration. (5) Scheduling showed no statistically significant relationship to skills integration.','Elementary education','Library science','Curricula','0','9217218'),(737,'Intervention procedures to enhance summer reading achievement','DT',1989,'Howes, Mary','Ed.D.','Northern Illinois University','','','','','','','','','','','','','United States','Northern Illinois University','United States','intervention','','','http://login.ezproxy.library.ualberta.ca/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/303729490?accountid=14474','The intent of this study was to determine whether regression in reading achievement occurs over the summer between first and second grade and to investigate the effect of two different summer programs.\r\n\r\nAchievement scores of a group of 201 students for May and October were analyzed according to sex and the Cognitive Skills Index (CSI) level. These children were divided into three groups. The first group received no summer intervention, the second group attended a school-sponsored summer school program, and the third group completed a public library summer reading program.\r\n\r\nThe results of the data analysis are as follows:\r\n\r\nAll children appear to have a significant gain between Gates MacGinitie Tests given in May and October; thus, it is concluded that there is no summer regression. Of the two intervention techniques, the gain shown by children attending summer school is low, but these children were placed in the program because of low achievement. On the other hand, there was a mean gain for all children completing the public library summer reading program. Unfortunately this gain is not uniform; i.e., girls benefit more than boys, and the high CSI group benefit most of all. Even the low CSI group made considerable progress. The group to benefit least are the boys.\r\n\r\nThere is a general tendency for vocabulary to improve more than comprehension for boys and the reverse trend for girls.\r\n\r\nIf the choice has to be made between summer school and the public library summer reading program, then the library program can be considered more successful and cost effective. It is true that summer school attendees are often low achievers, but there is reason to believe that, properly motivated, a library program would be at least equally effective.\r\n\r\nAs in many other studies, girls have been shown to achieve significantly higher scores than boys at this age level, possibly due to the author\'s observation that academic materials and school environment are more suited to girls than boys.

The members of the public that have access to technology, and hence to information, are the haves; those without, the have nots of the information age. Because public libraries are closing at the rate of one a week, and, when providing computer based access, often charge, alternative sources must be found that provide the general public with technology based access.\r\n\r\nThis baseline survey of general public access examines another potential provider of microcomputer hardware and software access, the public, two-year community college library/learning center (LRC), and answers three questions: first, to what extent are two-year, community college library/learning centers providing general public access to microcomputer hardware and software; second, what are the factors that could be limiting such access; and third, what relationships exist between demographic variables (region, size of student enrollment, size of taxing district population, and library/learning center budget) and the provision of general public access to microcomputer software and hardware?\r\n\r\nThe findings show a large percentage (72%) of LRC administrators agreed or strongly agreed that LRCs should be providing general public access to microcomputer software and hardware. A larger number (92%) strongly agreed or agreed that providing general public access to information via microcomputer hardware and software is an important role. Most LRCs have microcomputer hardware (89%) and provide on-site, general public access to it (57%).

Factors potentially limiting access include: policies and practices; licensing, copyright and legal restrictions; attitudes; technological inhibitors; and fees.\r\n\r\nSince the community college historically provides academic support to the community, this institution is a logical choice when choosing providers of general public access to microcomputer based information accessed via the \"Information Superhighway.\"','Educational software','Community colleges','Library science','0','9430247'),(739,'Internet use to perform collection development among independent school librarians in the Pacific Northwest','DT',2001,'Clark, Kimbrely Samantha Adams','Ph.D.','The University of Alabama','','','','','','','','','','','','','United States','The University of Alabama','United States','survey ','','','http://login.ezproxy.library.ualberta.ca/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/304683168?accountid=14474','Collection development encompasses the professional activities of needs assessment, policy development, evaluation, selection, acquisition, and collection maintenance, which involves the preservation and weeding of resources.

To facilitate this investigation, the Inquiry Mode Questionnaire (InQ) and a demographic data form were distributed in a nation-wide survey. The study achieved an 80.3% (106) return rate, with a total of 97 surveys used for data analysis.\r\n\r\nThe literature review is organized in three segments: definitional dilemma, theoretical framework, and review of previous research. The definitional dilemma addressed issues concerning four similar, but not interchangeable, terms of cognitive styles, learning styles, personality styles, and thinking styles.\r\n\r\nData analyses included five analyses of variance (ANOVAs) to determine relationships, differences, and interactions based upon the subject\'s administrative role (public or technical), gender (female or male), and thinking style preference (synthesist, idealist, pragmatist, analyst, or realist). The dependent variable associated with this study was thinking style preference (synthesist, idealist, pragmatist, analyst, and realist). The two independent variables associated with this study were administrative role (public or technical service) and gender (female or male). As part of the ANOVA process, the interaction between gender and administrative role was analyzed. Data analysis also included descriptive information analysis, a cross tabulation computation, and a dyad comparison.\r\n\r\nNone of the 15 null hypotheses could be rejected based upon the ANOVA statistical computation using a.05 alpha level. However, the cross-tabulation and dyad analysis did reveal noteworthy findings, such as female library administrators were more likely to be idealist thinkers; male library administrators were more likely to be pragmatist and idealist thinkers; technical service administrators were more likely to be analyst, idealist, and pragmatist thinkers; and public service administrators were more likely to be idealist thinkers.\r\n\r\nFive findings were summarized in this study. They are: (a) the sample had a preference towards the flat thinking style; (b) a relationship between gender and thinking style exist; (c) a relationship between area of administrative responsibility and thinking style exist; (d) a difference in preferred thinking styles among administrative peers in the same institution was uncovered; and (e) the demographic analysis supported previous studies urging aggressive recruitment and diversity efforts for the library profession.\r\n\r\nSeven conclusions were highlighted in the study. They are: (a) the potential for developing the flat thinking style among the librarians participating in the study, (b) the influence of gender upon thinking style preference, (c) the influence of organizational differentiation upon thinking style preference, (d) the lack of previous research connecting thinking style research with librarianship, (e) the effects of team-based management implementation upon thinking style preference, (f) the influence of a non-diversified organization upon thinking style preference, and (g) an explanation for generalizations and stereotypes among library administrative peers.\r\n\r\nRecommendations for future study and enhancement of library management were included. Suggestions for improving library administration included incorporating thinking style research to help facilitate: (a) understanding among co-workers, (b) improving organizational communication, (c) providing opportunities for personal growth, and (d) providing opportunities for organizational growth.','Library science','Higher education','School administration','0','9839320'),(741,'Base library support of educational programs provided on U.S. Air Force bases','DT',1971,'Haysley, Frances Olmstead','M.A.','Chapman University','','','','','','','','','','','','','United States','Chapman University','United States','-','','','http://login.ezproxy.library.ualberta.ca/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/302560930?accountid=14474','Not available.

Information literacy is the ability to access, evaluate, and use information from a variety of sources (Doyle 1994, 29–33). These skills are process skills and should be taught collaboratively by classroom teachers and librarians within the curriculum and not in isolation. The variables of staffing, scheduling, library use, budget, resources, principal support, and collaboration were examined in this exploratory study to see how they related to the development of information literacy skills.\r\n\r\nThe literature review discussed the various definitions of information literacy, its attributes, and its historical development over the last thirty years. Each of the variables was discussed as to how it related to information literacy especially at the elementary level.\r\n\r\nThe librarians from the 2002 exemplary elementary schools in Texas were asked to complete a web-based questionnaire. Interviews were conducted with several of these librarians for a more in-depth look at the variables. A list of projects in which information literacy skills were taught was complied. The data from these two sources, combined with the information available on the Texas Education Agency web site about these exemplary schools, were analyzed.\r\n\r\nThe analysis showed that staffing at most schools included a certified librarian but clerical help was not always adequate. Resources and budgets were strong variables. The use of flexible scheduling fell short of the desired result though most of the libraries indicated that the regular schedule could be adjusted as needed. Principals supported the library especially by encouraging students to read. Principals also expected more collaboration to happen, than the librarians perceived was happening. The variable of collaboration occurred at less than 60% of the schools. Collaboration is such an important variable in teaching information literacy skills and yields such powerful results that it cannot be ignored. Librarians, classroom teachers, and principals need to find ways to increase opportunities for collaboration to happen. The findings of this research were summarized in a checklist of the characteristics of an exemplary school library program.','Library science','Information systems','Elementary education','0','3168568'),(743,'Essays on education','DT',2008,'Bhatt, Rachana','Ph.D.','University of Rochester','','','','','','','','','','','','','United States','University of Rochester','United States','Survey','','','http://login.ezproxy.library.ualberta.ca/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/304510865?accountid=14474','In the following chapters, aspects of the formal and informal education system are analyzed in an economic framework. The goal of these chapters is to quantify the impact of resources and rules, and the results are of particular interest to the policy makers and educators who administer them.\r\n\r\nChapter one provides a motivation and introduction for the work in chapters two through four. The second chapter quantifies how much leisure reading is induced by public library use, an ubiquitous source of low cost books. Reading builds important cognitive skills in children and adults alike. Individuals who use the public library are not random, and in the presence of any unobserved heterogeneity which affects the library use decision as well as how much time is spent reading, standard ordinary least squares estimation (OLS) techniques will produce biased estimates. To overcome this, I use an instrumental variables (IV) approach, where the instrument is a household\'s distance to their closest public library. Using merged data from the Current Population Survey and American Time Use Survey, I estimate that individuals age 15 and over who used the library at least once in the past month read about 35 more minutes per day than individuals who did not. This increase in reading time comes at the expense of time spent watching television, and there is no statistically significant effect on other leisure and non-leisure activities. To examine the impact of library use for children, I use data from the National Household Education Survey and find that library use has a positive impact on homework completion rates, but these results are not robust to geographic aggregation of the data.\r\n\r\nThe third chapter examines the impact of gifted and talented program participation on the academic and peer group outcomes of children who participated in the program during their 8th grade year. Gifted programs are a specific form of ability tracking that exist in elementary schools in the U.S., where only the highest ability children are given a supplemental curriculum to their traditional school course work. Participation in a gifted program is not random, so to estimate the causal effect of participation I use an IV approach. The instrument is a measure of each child\'s relative likelihood of being admitted into the program, and is based on the criteria the child\'s school uses for gifted admission. This measure is constructed by interacting three variables: (i) the criteria used by the school to admit the student into the gifted program, (ii) a measure of how each child fulfills this criteria, and (iii) a measure of how the child\'s classmates fulfill this criteria. Using data from the National Educational Longitudinal Survey, I find that participation in a gifted program has a large and positive impact on math test scores in the year immediately following participation, but this effect dwindles over time. Moreover, I find that participation has no effect on the quality of a child\'s peer group, nor on the child\'s self-reported interest in school. A larger effect of participation on test scores is found for children in more rigorous programs.\r\n\r\nThe fourth chapter analyzes the effect of school lunch period lengths on children\'s nutrition. According to medical evidence, it takes 20 minutes for an individual to feel full once they begin eating, so individuals with short meal lengths are more likely to over-consume compared to those with lengthier meals. To assess whether short lunch lengths have some explanatory power for the prevalence of overweight school children, I use data from the School Nutrition Dietary Assessment-III. The length of time a child has for lunch may not be random since there are many unobserved school characteristics that may be related to lunch length and children\'s nutrition, as well as the possibility that certain types of children choose to attend schools with short/lengthy lunch periods. To deal with unobserved school characteristics, I control for a comprehensive set of school lunch period characteristics, and to proxy for unobserved characteristics of children, I include information about the child\'s home dietary habits. The OLS estimates controlling for these, and other variables suggest that a 10 minute increase in a child\'s assigned lunch length will reduce his BMI by 0.22 points and decreases his probability of being overweight by 2.3%. In addition, I use a school fixed effects (FE) estimation, which relies on variation among a small and select sample of schools that assign different lunch lengths to children in different grades, and find that a 10 minute increase in lunch length decreases the probability of being overweight by 5.5% and reduces BMI by 0.36 points.

During a 4-5 week period, 10 students from one class were required to choose potential future careers and write a research paper on the college preparation, whereas the 38 students from the other two classes were required to create a foldable on a genetic disorder of their choice. Data were collected through a demographic questionnaire, process surveys at three times (initiation, mid-point and completion), observation, and semi-structured interviews with students and teachers. All manipulated data from the questionnaire and process surveys were statistically analyzed. To corroborate the findings from the questionnaires and process surveys, field notes and transcripts were underwent content analysis.\r\n\r\nThis study shows what ELL students experience when searching for information throughout the course of a research project in English and what factors interact with individuals’ primary patterns in their information behavior. The findings indicate that having a fluent English speaker or using some English at home gives ELL students more confidence in their English language abilities, which might impact their information behavior. Among the ELL groups, only the intermediate ELL group exhibited significant increases in estimated knowledge and in positive feelings, particularly relief and satisfaction, as they progressed in their research project. In addition, this study addresses how ELL students’ research process is influenced by gender, ethnicity, and the nature of the research task.\r\n\r\nThis study sheds light on how cultural and linguistic background can influence people’s information seeking and use.

Teachers evaluated characterization, writing style, and theme, a literary analysis of the work, while students focused on the authenticity of character behaviors, an analysis of their personal connection to the protagonist who mirrored their maturational development.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this study was to describe the intersection of Havighurst\'s Adolescent Task development and the characteristics of the most circulated twenty five fiction titles in eleven selected Texas middle school libraries in grades six through eight. Twenty five novels with the highest percentage of overall circulation were identified for this content analysis. First, this study described the bibliographic characteristics of the twenty five most circulated novels. Secondly, this study examined which of Havighurst\'s Adolescent Developmental Tasks occurred most frequently within the narrative structures of these novels. Finally, the researcher analyzed the protagonist\'s actions, dialogue, internal thoughts, and reputation within the plot to determine in what way the protagonist\'s development was related to Adolescent Tasks within the narrative structure.\r\n\r\nThe analysis revealed three distinct types of middle school novels with characteristics appealing to specific reading audiences. Linearly developed protagonists in series books narrowly focused on two distinct Adolescent Tasks, achieving independence from parents and understanding changing family roles. Sets of sequels provided enough predictability to support comprehension but developed complex characters that matured while interacting with all of the Adolescent Tasks. The character development in sequels proceeded from a conflict Task that was further developed in the rising action. Stand alone novels presented the most complex character development connected to all Adolescent Tasks because these characters developed abstractly from conflict to resolution. Each type of middle school novel required different maturational expectations from the middle school readers who bring their own experiences to the text.\r\n\r\nThe results from this study will empower adults with new knowledge of what characteristics adolescents are looking for in their literature and make the connection between adolescent development and what qualities they seek in the literature they select from their school libraries. Most importantly, the conclusions from this study will help educators, librarians, and parents bridge the gap between what adults perceive as excellence in adolescent literature, and what adolescents select for their own reading.','Library science','Secondary education','Literacy','0','3340586'),(750,'Capital and opportunity: A critical ethnography of high school students at -risk','DT',2000,'Pasco, Rebecca Jeanne','Ph.D.','Emporia State University','','','','','','','','','','','','','United States','Emporia State University','United States','observations','','','http://login.ezproxy.library.ualberta.ca/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/304672408?accountid=14474','This study used the theory of Pierre Bourdieu to investigate what types of economic, social, cultural and symbolic capital influenced the individual academic achievement and personal life trajectories of female, high school students identified as at-risk. The critical ethnography collected data from classroom observations, critical dialogues and discussions between the researcher and participants over a four month period in a high school in the Midwest. The qualitative study produced a description of the types of capital that influenced each participant\'s personal life and academic achievement as situated within each participant\'s specific sociocultural scenario. The study critiqued the use of Bourdieu\'s theories for a study of students at-risk and produced findings which correlated each type of capital to each participant\'s academic achievement and personal life trajectory. The study concluded that (a) criteria for the label “at-risk” should include factors within the school as well as those outside the school, (b) schools privilege the knowledge and behaviors of some individuals over others, (c) the participants identified and used separate and distinct street and school “selves” to maximize their capital in settings inside and outside the school, and (d) school policies and practices which restrict access to certain types of information place at-risk students in a position of educational disadvantage.','Educational sociology','Academic guidance counseling','Library science','0','9962487'),(751,'Development of an instrument to assess middle school students\' perceptions of book choice experiences in school: The Book Choice Survey','DT',2000,'Jewell, Mary Jean Simpson','Ed.D.','Peabody College for Teachers of Vanderbilt University','','','','','','','','','','','','','United States','Peabody College for Teachers of Vanderbilt University','United States','multitrait-multimethod (MTMM)','observations','interviews','http://login.ezproxy.library.ualberta.ca/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/304589232?accountid=14474','This study involved development and validation of a new assessment tool, the Book Choice Survey (BCS). A 46-item self-report measure was designed to assess use of book selection strategies, specifically to what extent students (a) are influenced by others, (b) attend to text features, and (c) demonstrate autonomy when choosing library books. The rationale for development of this instrument is grounded in a literature review, a teacher-research pilot study, and informal observations and interviews in the field.\r\n\r\nThe BCS was administered to over 1,000 students in middle school library settings. Validation was conducted through item evaluation, hypothesis testing, and a multitrait-multimethod (MTMM) procedure. Item evaluation and hypothesis testing indicate that the BCS is moderately reliable and provide some support for its validity. When response patterns were compared, significant differences existed among achievement, grade level, and gender groups, and among students reporting high and low levels of satisfaction with self-selected children\'s literature. These differences were corroborated in a review of prior research in the field.\r\n\r\nHowever, when response patterns were compared in the MTMM phase of study, evidence of validity was lacking. Findings from three methods, (a) student responses to the BCS, (b) teacher estimates of student responses to the BCS, and (c) individual student interviews, were unrelated. Problems with methodology were noted in the MTMM phase of the study; these may have contributed to the results found through this analysis.\r\n\r\nDue to the MTMM findings, reliability and validity evidence regarding the BCS is inconclusive at this time. Additional validation efforts should be undertaken, and an agenda for future research is proposed. Until further study takes place, the BCS should be used with caution and in combination with other measures to increase understanding of students\' perceptions regarding book choice experiences. Under such conditions, the BCS may help to identify where problems exist, which is a first step in determining necessary action to facilitate students\' use of book selection strategies in the middle school grades.','Educational evaluation','Literacy','Reading instruction','0','9991714'),(752,'Be careful little eyes what you see: Factors affecting challenges to materials in private college preparatory school libraries','DT',2006,'Franklin, Renee E.','Ph.D.','The Florida State University','','','','','','','','','','','','','United States','The Florida State University','United States','survey ','interviews','','http://login.ezproxy.library.ualberta.ca/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/305332092?accountid=14474','This study examines the state of materials challenges in private college preparatory school libraries located in the Southeast United States.

It explores the decisions leaders make about restructuring, focusing on their organizational visions. It does so in the context of new organizations evolving on college campuses as the result of mergers between academic libraries and computer centers. A phenomenological approach was used to uncover leaders\' own perceptions about the processes and factors involved in deciding on an organizational structure for a new enterprise. The metaphor of a journey on the frontier emerged as characterizing how these pioneers moved towards a new future for their organizations.\r\n\r\nIn this study seven Chief Information Officers (CIOs) from medium-sized institutions were interviewed about their experiences creating Information Services units. Their individual stories are used to portray the essence of the experience of leading the creation of a new organizational vision and structure. The study identifies key factors that lead to institution-specific choices of structures, four mechanisms used to embed vision in structure, and eight vectors of the choice process in the merger context. Key themes included evolution vs. revolution, respecting existing cultures, coming together around the work, natural areas of overlap, idealism vs. pragmatism, opportunism, and collaboration, communication, cooperation.\r\n\r\nThe dynamics involved with multiple cultures and identities are an essential component of the leader\'s role as change agent in the merger context. The constant comparative method was employed to make some preliminary propositions, referred to as “lessons learned,” about the interrelationship between how CIOs approached the task of changing organizational identities and the organizational structures that emerged. These leaders\' experiences also shed light on the integration of new organizational forms on campus, indicating that flattened hierarchies and web, lattice, network, and team structures can be used effectively to create synergies between units and to build organizational flexibility.

Assuming the role as \"Guardian of Science\" and \"social status judge\" (Zuckerman & Merton, 1971), peer-review, the quality control system of science, directly affects the growth of science, scientists\' academic career and their institutions. The very basic tenet of the peer review system is its assumed objectivity. Bias in editorial peer review process, however, is inevitable. The constitution of the blind peer review mechanism is itself a simply undeniable acknowledgment of that fact.\r\n\r\nTherefore, this study investigated potential peer-review bias by examining the core peer-reviewed academic journal publications of the field between 1994 and 2003, through the methods of social network analysis. In addition to some descriptive analysis on the overall state of the field, based on the criterion of centrality, focus was specifically given to two networks (co-authorship network and institutional network) and the network structure for patterns that might indicate bias in terms of author, gender, author-affiliated institution, country, number of articles published and number of journals in which the author published.\r\n\r\nFindings of this research revealed no discernable patterns nor network-wide centralization in either the co-authorship network or the institution network. Thus, no reason exists to suspect the objectivity of the peer-review process of the five core academic journals of comparative and international education 1994--2003 on the base of centrality. Further descriptive analyses, however, did reveal patterns that may represent norms of the field and, thus, may suggest potential sources of bias. Findings indicated that (1) scholars of the field tend to research independently and publish in relative isolation, and single-authored journal articles are the norm of the field; (2) the field is dominated by the scholars and institutions of Western countries, especially the U.K and the U.S; and (3) journals of the field tend to publish more authors from the hosting countries of the journal.

What began as an investigation of an apparent gap in understanding between the views of teens and school librarians regarding \"information literacy\" ended up being a discovery of young adult information cultures—or \"small worlds,\" as described by Elfreda Chatman (1999).\r\n\r\nInformation literacy, as it is defined within the school environment, often neglects the information experience of teens outside of the school. Therefore, emphasis in schools is placed on everyday life information seeking (\"ELIS\"; Savolainen, 1995) of teens operating within the dominant discourse of information literacy as defined by the school librarians and within the epistemology of schooling, where there are explicit limits on legitimate uses, definitions, technologies, and even inquiries of and about \"information.\"\r\n\r\nThe irony, however, is that while the core objectives of teaching information literacy include critical thinking and evaluation, the discourse of information literacy relates little to the empowered decision-making of teens in their everyday information behaviors at home, work, and in schoolwork tasks outside of the school library. This thesis delineates the small worlds of teens relative to their librarians, with an emphasis on the teen experience. However, the evidence suggests that both student and librarian are limited within the context of the school library by dominant information literacy discourses, and that both communities may benefit from including their own lived information behaviors within the schooling environment and its attendant tasks. Essentially, the study takes critical-theory (Foucault, 1980) and Pragmatic, inquiry-based (Dewey, 1938) approaches to information literacy as defined within formal learning environments and calls for a practical, ELIS-based approach in our school libraries. The alternative embraced by a continued defense of information literacy as currently defined is professional irrelevance.\r\n\r\nUsing discourse analysis (Gee, 1999) as a methodological lens makes explicit the knowledge domains of high school students and school librarians. Findings include: (1) information behaviors of high school students and school librarians appear to be concordant in informal information seeking, mirroring one another\'s knowledge domains and consistent with ELIS theories; (2) however, in formal information tasks such as those for a school assignment, school librarians\' understandings—or at least their practices—regarding what makes students information \"literate\" are restrictive, focusing on issues of legitimacy rather than effectiveness; (3) \"small world\" knowledge domains of high school students are neglected in school information tasks, and this has implications for student access, agency, and identity; and (4) there appears to be an opportunity to draw on the lived information behaviors of both communities to make the term \"information literate\" more inclusive, flexible, and adaptable; ultimately having pedagogical implications.','Library science','Educational technology','Information science','0','3600661'),(758,'Effect of the introduction of team management on the leadership role and skills needed to lead teams: A case study','DT',2004,'Kascus, Marie A.','D.A.','Simmons College','','','','','','','','','','','','','United States','Simmons College','United States','focus group','interview','questionnaire','http://login.ezproxy.library.ualberta.ca/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/305101893?accountid=14474','Teams are considered a powerful management structure with the potential to increase productivity, improve quality, empower people and enable organizations to successfully meet changing demands.

There is much in the literature about the importance of the leadership role in teams despite the different ways of conceptualizing the role; and there is agreement that the role and function of the leader is very important to successful team outcomes. Teams do offer the power and potential to accomplish the goals of the organization and to satisfy the needs of individuals for participation, but they represent a different way of working that requires new manager skills and behaviors for team effectiveness and success. This is a case study of the leadership role of teams at the University of Connecticut Libraries.

Because school libraries are usually the first place to introduce new educational technologies, school librarians are expected to have a positive attitude and perspective regarding the effectiveness and merits of new technologies. Meanwhile, simultaneous implementation of digital textbooks is planned in K-12 schools in the U.S. state of Florida and the country of South Korea, and school librarians are supposed to play a pivotal role in this adoption. However, there have been very few studies conducted to identify any patterns or consistencies in librarians\' perceptions of innovation.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this study is to identify and describe the concerns of Floridian and South Korean librarians during the initial phases of the implementation of digital textbooks. For each setting, the study not only determines the stages of concern as per school librarians\' practices and experiences, but also classifies those stages of concern by demographic backgrounds.\r\n\r\nThis study used the Concerns-Based Adoption Model (CBAM) as a theoretical framework. The comparative research design applying a survey method was used, incorporating the Stages of Concern Questionnaire (SoCQ) with other demographic questions. The SoCQ percentile scores were used to identify school librarians\' Stages of Concern (SoC) in Florida and South Korea. T-tests explored the similarities and differences of SoC in two locations.\r\n\r\nThe study revealed that school librarians in both places expressed the highest response in Stage 0, Unconcerned, implying they were more concerned about a multitude of other obligations, activities, or innovations. The CBAM theory anticipates that there will be potential resistance from school librarians towards digital textbook implementation in two locations, as the SoC from Florida school librarians presented a Negative One-Two Split user pattern and those from South Korea presented a typical non-user pattern. Also, this study found that, according to their characteristics, school librarians showed the biggest gaps of concerns in the Impact stages (Stages 4, 5, and 6) while having relatively high concerns in the Self stages (Stages 0, 1, and 2). In Florida\'s case, all profiles presented a relationship between SoC and participants\' characteristics, with the biggest gaps occurring in Stage 5, Collaboration. South Korean school librarians\' SoC profiles found the largest gaps in the Impact stages. Research Question 3 revealed that South Korean school librarians expressed more concern over the three stages: 0, Unconcerned; 1, Informational; and 2, Personal.\r\n\r\nBased on the CBAM theory, the findings underscore a need for various interventions. Since school librarians\' were found to be apathetic even though digital textbook integration will be put into effect soon, an intervention to inform them of the characteristics and strong points of digital textbooks, as well as restrictions for using them, is urgent (Stage 0). Moreover, the study findings argue that it is urgent to introduce various interventions for specific groups of participants. For example, South Korean school librarians, who had the second-highest concern in Stage 1, Informational, need to receive general information including benefits and costs of digital textbooks. Florida school librarians, who had the second-highest concern in Stage 2, Personal, need guidance to prioritize digital textbooks, and they also need continuous encouragement.\r\n\r\nThe results from the study stress the importance of professional development for school librarians. Data from the study provides administrators with information regarding interventions that were targeted and customized according to school librarians\' characteristics. Moreover, for policy makers, the theory recommends gradual implementation of digital textbooks in Florida and pilot test opportunities in South Korea. Lastly, the study urges library and information science education to have short- and long-term strategies for embracing digital textbooks.','Library science','Educational leadership','Educational technology','0','3705845'),(763,'Participants\' perceptions of the impact of the Wonder of Reading program','DT',2003,'Robertson, Marilyn Nottingham','Ed.D.','University of Southern California','','','','','','','','','','','','','United States','University of Southern California','United States','surveys','interviews','','http://login.ezproxy.library.ualberta.ca/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/305319383?accountid=14474','The Wonder of Reading is a nonprofit organization committed to renovating, restocking, and providing training for volunteer reading partners in elementary schools in the Los Angeles area.

An embedded case study research design was used to explore the perceived role of the public library, guiding policy framework, and factors constraining the implementation of after-school activities in 3 of the system 20 branches serving at-risk youth; semi-structured interviews with 21 participants comprising teenagers engaged in after-school activities, parents, librarians, library managers, and members of the Friends of the library; observations of teenagers’ behaviors in the library setting; and publicly available document on the subject. The data were inductively coded and then subjected to a content analytical procedure, which revealed 5 after-school themes: bridging a digital divide, teen and community needs, public policy, and public service. The key finding of this study indicates an absence of a system-wide formal policy in how after-school services are provided across library branches for at-risk teenagers. The study concludes with recommendations to reexamine the existing after-school programs in a way that better incorporates the unique needs of library patrons and to align policies with these needs in order to better serve at-risk youth within the context of their communities.','Library science','Public administration','Public policy','0','10174012'),(766,'A comparison of information content between print and listserv job advertisements in academic librarian positions','DT',2005,'Davis, Marian G.','Ed.S.','Central Missouri State University','','','','','','','','','','','','','United States','Central Missouri State University','United States','chi-square','t-tests ','','http://login.ezproxy.library.ualberta.ca/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/305370332?accountid=14474','This study investigated the differences in the amount of information presented in academic librarian print and listserv job ads.

The study examines their initial motivations for their decisions to become teacher-librarians, the ways they negotiate work relationships with their classroom teacher-colleagues, and the ways they negotiate relationships with their families and their friends. Through a series of in-depth interviews, eighteen women who carry out their work in central city, commuter shed and rural schools in Kentucky tell about their life histories and their experiences as elementary school teacher-librarians. In their life history narratives, participants describe their understanding of their work, the meaning their work holds for them and the place of their work in their lives. Participants described a desire for autonomy as one of their initial motivations for becoming teacher-librarians. They construct autonomy as having a degree of freedom from bureaucratic strictures and a measure of control over their work. The literature on teachers and teaching suggests two very different meanings for autonomy: autonomy as a kind of distancing from relationships with others and autonomy as being in-relations with colleagues. The data suggests that teacher-librarians achieve a greater degree of autonomy when they are in-relations with their classroom teacher-colleagues. They negotiate these relationships to form the effective networks necessary to carry out their work. The effective network acts as a foundation for the operation of a collaborative school culture. Teacher-librarians are also members of extended networks with links that are fashioned from kinship and friendship. The data suggests that the participants\' personal lives significantly shape their work lives through their subjective experiences as wives, mothers, single women, daughters and friends. This study concludes that it is who these teacher-librarians are that determines the meaning they give to their work and how they translate that meaning into professional practice.','Library science','Elementary education','Womens studies','1','9948859'),(768,'Selection or censorship?

This mixed-method research project examines whether public high school library professionals are self-censoring their library collections when it comes to materials with LGBTQ themes. Quantitative data were collected from 120 Ohio public high school libraries, while 12 school librarians were interviewed. The study found that school libraries tended to have significantly fewer LGBTQ-themed books than titles with other kinds of controversial content, but that certain factors, including schools with large number of students; schools with a racially diverse student body; schools located in liberal-leaning communities; and schools that employ certified librarians, are present in schools with more inclusive LGBTQ collections. Qualitative findings supported the quantitative analyses and stressed the importance of a supportive community and administration when developing a quality, inclusive library collection.','Language arts','Library science','GLBT Studies','1','3670819'),(769,'Technology, forecasting, and ambiguity: A study of university decision making during the construction of twenty -first century academic libraries','DT',2008,'Mash, Samuel David','Ph.D.','University of South Carolina','','','','','','','','','','','','','United States','University of South Carolina','United States','survey','','','http://login.ezproxy.library.ualberta.ca/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/304493352?accountid=14474','This dissertation explores the process of higher education decision making during the construction of new academic libraries at American universities, with special attention to the influence of technology forecasts. The \"organized anarchy\" model of decision making, also known as the garbage can model (Cohen, March & Olsen, 1972; Kingdon, 1995) was used as the conceptual framework for analyzing and interpreting the data collected for this research.\r\n\r\nFour research questions are addressed. First, for the period 1990-2007, what were the most frequently published forecasts related to technology in academic libraries? Second, how do library directors and other key decision making participants describe decision making during the construction of new academic libraries? Third, how do library directors and other key decision making participants describe the use of technology forecasts during the construction of new academic libraries? Fourth, what additional internal and external elements influenced decision making during the construction of new academic libraries?\r\n\r\nFindings confirm the descriptive rigor of the model. Additional phenomena, coherent with the model and appropriate to the focus of this study, are identified. These include forecast agnosticism, microcoupling, isomorphism, and asymmetric influence. Though the data for this dissertation are best understood through an adaptation of the original garbage can model, its fundamental tenets are retained and affirmed.\r\n\r\nFindings also suggest important areas for future research. These include librarians and entrepreneurship, the library within university decision making streams, and institutional decision making as consumer choice. Furthermore, the methodology used in this research provides a facile model for the application of garbage can analysis beyond the library and, indeed, beyond the university. For researchers interested in corporate, government, professional, and even personal decision making the approach of this study offers a ready starting point for further exploration.','Library science','School administration','Educational technology','1','3332227'),(770,'A case study of faculty perceptions of information literacy and its integration into the curriculum','DT',2008,'McAdoo, Monty L.','Ed.D.','Indiana University of Pennsylvania','','','','','','','','','','','','','United States','Indiana University of Pennsylvania','United States','case study','survey','','http://login.ezproxy.library.ualberta.ca/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/304405543?accountid=14474','Since it first appeared in the 1970s, the term \"information literacy\" (IL) has been defined and interpreted in many ways. While much has been written about IL, a significant portion of the literature on this topic is limited to library and information science journals. As a result, if they are familiar with the term at all, faculty outside of these disciplines often have limited or different understandings of the term and its application. This lack of familiarity is a recognized obstacle to implementing successful IL programs and initiatives. However, the research on this topic is extremely limited and tends to focus on students and programs rather than faculty. Through the use of a survey, this study examined faculty understandings of IL and its integration into the curriculum at one University. The results of this study suggest general agreement among faculty about the desirability of incorporating IL instruction into the entire curriculum and the belief that all faculty should play a role. But, the results also indicate that faculty members do not feel the University has a clear definition for IL. Although faculty seem to have an awareness of the importance of IL, their lack of knowledge of IL could, in part, explain why they are not clear about specific curricular expectations regarding such. Consistent with the literature, survey data suggest that what definitions and perceptions are in place tend to focus more on the skill-based components of IL rather than the cognitive, process-based ones.','Library science','School administration','Curricula','1','3320033'),(771,'The effects of automation on hiring practices and staff allocations in academic libraries in four-year and two-year institutions in Tennessee','DT',1997,'Kenerson, Murle Edward','Ed.D.','Tennessee State University','','','','','','','','','','','','','United States','Tennessee State University','United States','survey','','','http://login.ezproxy.library.ualberta.ca/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/304406932?accountid=14474','The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of automation on hiring practices and staff allocations in four-year and two-year, public and private academic libraries in Tennessee.

The study\'s hypotheses stated that (a) there would be no significant differences in the numbers of professional librarians in academic libraries when the library becomes automated, (b) there would be no significant differences in support staff in academic libraries when the library becomes automated, (c) there would be no significant differences in the numbers of \"other\" professional staff in academic libraries when the library becomes automated, and (d) hiring policies, for example, specific skills sought, would not have changed when the library becomes automated. After analyzing the results, the null hypotheses were accepted at.05 level of significance using t test, proportions, and percentages. The consensus of the literature tended to indicate that automation may have a positive or negative effect on staffing procedures in the academic library. Most strategies utilized in the process of computerization assume the efficacy of a role/task approach to staffing. It is recommended that further studies be undertaken to determine (a) whether automation in the academic library has resulted in increased productivity of staff, (b) whether automation and upgrading of job descriptions of support staff leads to a breakdown in the traditional organizational structure, and (c) what positions are most affected by the changes brought on by automation.','Library science','Higher education','School administration','1','9907850'),(772,'The relationship between computer skills and the levels of technostress among faculty and academic librarians from selected institutions within the University System of Georgia','DT',2003,'Shepherd, Sonya Senithia Gaither','Ed.D.','Georgia Southern University','','','','','','','','','','','','','United States','Georgia Southern University','United States','surveys ','','','http://login.ezproxy.library.ualberta.ca/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/305247906?accountid=14474','The struggle to adjust to rapid technological change has increased for the majority of the population, especially those in higher education.

The sample included 504 articles published in two school psychology journals and a special education journal from 1975–1977. The prediction of article citation frequency from author gender, institutional affiliation, and publication productivity was examined. The effects of article content, research design, statistical procedure, journal, and journal specialty on article citation frequency also were investigated.\r\n\r\nResults from the regression analyses indicated that article content and authors\' publication frequency significantly predicted article citation frequency. Consultation articles were cited more frequently over the 20-year period than assessment, intervention, and issue related articles. Articles written by authors with high publication rates were cited more often than articles published by authors with fewer publications.\r\n\r\nCorrelational analyses revealed several significant relationships among the independent variables. Author publication productivity was positively related to author gender and institutional affiliation. Male authors and authors from academic institutions were associated with higher publication rates. Journal specialty was correlated with author institutional affiliation. A significant relationship between research design and statistical procedure also was discovered.\r\n\r\nThis study provided limited evidence of the influence of particularism and accumulative advantage on article citation frequency. Only a small proportion of the variance in article citation frequency could be explained by the variables under investigation. The emphasis on consultation articles found in this study is consistent with trends occurring in school psychology and special education. The lack of bias in article citations of female-authored works also is reflective of the greater representation of women on school psychology university faculty and editorial review boards. Article citation frequency appears to be an adequate measure of influence.

The academic and social well being of the home schooled students was investigated and an attempt was made to find out in what ways home schoolers utilize public libraries and computers. The influence of religion upon the Willows\' home schoolers was also investigated.\r\n\r\nThe results of the research show that, with some exceptions, the home schooled students in Willows are not suffering academically or socially when compared to their public school peers. However, it should be emphasized that, based upon achievement test scores, most students (home schooled or otherwise) in Willows generally perform poorly. The research also demonstrates that the Willows\' home schoolers do rely upon their public library in a way that heretofore has not been shown in other studies. However, their dependence upon the local library is mitigated by at least an equal reliance upon materials provided by the Glenn County Office of Education. On the other hand, the home schoolers in Willows are generally computer illiterate and computers were of dubious use to them in 1994.\r\n\r\nOne unexpected and possibly important phenomenon discovered in the course of the research was the difference in academic performance by home schooled students of varying ages. In short, younger home schooled students generally performed poorly, while older home schooled students performed quite well on academic achievement tests. This held true within family groups among siblings. This is a phenomenon which other researchers might possibly analyze to see if this result holds true with home schoolers elsewhere and if so, why.\r\n\r\nAnd finally, the study also shows that religion was a relatively unimportant motivating factor for the home schoolers in Willows in 1994. With the exception of this last finding, the conclusions of this study are all consistent with the conclusions of other reputable studies on home schooling.\r\n\r\nThe findings of the study led the author to conclude that cooperative efforts between libraries, county offices of education, school districts, and home schoolers concerning the acquisition of schooling materials and/or computer use would be useful in serving home schoolers. The coordination of the various agencies involved with home schoolers would avoid the duplication of services and it may encourage home schoolers to better utilize already existing facilities and resources. Such cooperative efforts could be effected at little or no additional expense to school agencies. Future research that would encourage such cooperation as well as research that would encourage computer on-line usage among home schoolers would be worthwhile.','Educational sociology','Families & family life','Personal relationships','1','9602454'),(775,'Occupational vulnerability: A study of novice school librarians','DT',2014,'Frye, Julie Marie','Ph.D.',' Indiana University','','','','','','','','','','','','','United States',' Indiana University','United States','observations','interviews','document analysis','http://login.ezproxy.library.ualberta.ca/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1564763912?accountid=14474','Using Callahan\'s (1962) vulnerability thesis as a theoretical framework, this qualitative case studies research examines the occupational socialization of secondary, public school librarians.

The study addresses the challenges and successes that novice school librarians encounter or bring about during their early years in the profession. The study also examines how critical events create professional identities of school librarians, and how narratives of vulnerability (re)produce culture myths about teaching and librarianship.\r\n\r\nIn order to have a better understanding of the occupational socialization of the school librarian participants, I collected data from multiple sources for each of the cases. The procedures included direct observations, interviews, and document analysis. The research began while participants were student teaching, and data was collected until their second year of practice.\r\n\r\nThe results of the analysis indicate that participants\' student teaching placements provided polarized experiences to model their practices after: either unrealistic or unacceptable. All participants express that they were unprepared for their service in public schools, and they were unsupported by their administrators in their first school librarian positions. In addition, they convey great discomfort with the \"myths\" of their clerical work that their administrators or job titles demanded. The study suggests that in spite of their perceived inadequate socialization, school librarian participants exhibit strength in the midst of great occupational challenges and role uncertainty.','Educational sociology','Library science','Teacher education','1','3631273'),(776,'Teaching the voices of history through primary sources and historical fiction: A case study of teacher and librarian roles','DT',2011,'Stripling, Barbara Kay','D.P.S.','Syracuse University','','','','','','','','','','','','','United States','Syracuse University','United States','case study','observations','interviews ','http://login.ezproxy.library.ualberta.ca/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/869500398?accountid=14474','The ability to analyze alternative points of view and to empathize (understand the beliefs, attitudes and actions of another from the other\'s perspective rather than from one\'s own) are essential building blocks for learning in the 21st century. Empathy for the human participants of historical times has been deemed by a number of educators as important for the development of historical understanding. The classroom teacher and the school librarian both have a prominent stake in creating educational experiences that foster the development of perspective, empathy, and understanding.\r\n\r\nThis case study was designed to investigate the idea that teaching with primary sources and historical novels during historical inquiry enhances students\' development of cognitive and emotive empathy. The study was framed around two research questions: How do classroom teachers and school librarians design and teach historical inquiry using historical novels and primary sources? What is the impact of teaching with historical novels and primary sources on the development of historical empathy?\r\n\r\nThe case study was conducted in an English/history humanities block and the school library in a New York City secondary school. Data were collected through classroom observations, interviews with the classroom teachers and librarian, and samples of student work. On the use of primary sources and historical novels, the study found that primary sources must be surrounded by context to be useful to students in their learning, that secondary sources were necessary for providing that context, and that historical fiction provides social context, but its use must be scaffolded to help students distinguish fiction from fact. In addition, the study found that unless library linkages to primary sources are embedded in classroom instruction, they are not used by students or teachers. In answer to the second research question, the study found that primary sources have a strong impact on the development of historical empathy if their use is mediated by a teacher or librarian and that cognitive empathy must be developed before emotive empathy. Finally, this case study showed that a school librarian\'s effectiveness is diminished by fulfilling a resource-provider role with no integration into classroom instruction.','Library science','Secondary education','Social studies education','1','3454424'),(777,'Finders keepers: A comparative study investigating teaching the Florida Research Process FINDS model through three different approaches at the elementary school level','DT',2009,'Serrell, Karen K.','Ed.D.','University of Central Florida','','','','','','','','','','','','','United States','University of Central Florida','United States','Florida Research Process FINDS Model','survey ','interviews','http://login.ezproxy.library.ualberta.ca/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/89195771?accountid=14474','The children’s taunt “Finders Keepers, Losers Weepers” gives new credence to the information search process at the elementary school level.

The first curricular approach uses direct instruction to teach children how to do research using the Florida Research Process FINDS Model. The second approach pairs the FINDS Model with a unit of study that is related to classroom curriculum. The third approach examines the FINDS Model in conjunction with project learning, a constructivist model based on student interest.

Quantitative data was collected with an information literacy pre and post test, and an anonymous media lessons’ survey about student preferences. Qualitative data were gathered through a review of student work samples and student interviews. Statistically significant gains were found between the pre to post test scores for all three groups, however no statistically significant differences were found among groups. Although quantitative data did not reveal differences among the treatment groups, qualitative findings revealed that the group taught research skills through the connection to classroom curriculum approach performed better.

In this environment, academic libraries need to be adaptable organizations. Librarianship, though, is deeply rooted in strong values and beliefs which inherently limit receptivity to change and innovation, but these constraints are not absolute. Social network research indicates that professional advice networks play a significant role in how one thinks about and performs work and that individual perspectives are broadened when diverse input is received. Based on social network analysis methods, this study explored the relationship between individual receptivity to innovation and the composition of a person\'s professional advice network through a purposive sample of academic librarians in Illinois. The group completed a survey that explored two dimensions: (1) the nature of relationships within their professional advice network and (2) the individual\'s personal receptivity to innovation. Analysis of the nature of relationships within the professional advice networks was based on a combination of quantitative and qualitative techniques, in contrast to the analysis of the respondents\' receptivity to innovation which was based on quantitative measures. Based on the information from the 440 respondents, the results of this research indicate that there is a relationship between the size of the professional advice networks and individual\'s receptivity to innovation, but additional aspects of the professional advice network may play a role in an individual\'s overall receptivity to innovation.','Library science','Management','School administration','1','3267755'),(779,'A study of factors related to possible cooperative procedures among film libraries of the Rocky Mountain -Great Plains area','DT',1954,'Alford, John D.','Ed.D.','University of Wyoming','','','','','','','','','','','','','United States','University of Wyoming','United States','-','','','http://login.ezproxy.library.ualberta.ca/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/302025863?accountid=14474','Not available.

Organizational analysis revealed four organizational factors: hierarchy, autonomous, relational, and professional. Job satisfaction, affective and continuous commitment, and intent to leave were measured through a survey instrument. Analysis indicated that individual factors did not produce significant effects on satisfaction, commitment, or intent to leave, while organizational factors did have a significant effect on satisfaction, commitment, and intent to leave. Using libraries that represented the organizational factors, individual and organizational areas of agreement and lack of agreement were examined to determine the person-organization fit of the librarians and to determine effects on satisfaction, commitment, and intent to leave in these representative libraries. Greatest alignment of values occurred in the relational libraries, while the least alignment of values occurred in the hierarchy.','Library science','Management','School administration','1','3056983'),(783,'Machiavellianism among college and university library directors','DT',1995,'McBride, Regina Claire','Ph.D.','Saint Louis University','','','','','','','','','','','','','United States','Saint Louis University','United States','survey','','','http://login.ezproxy.library.ualberta.ca/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/304242381?accountid=14474','This research investigated the Machiavellian orientation of randomly selected college and university library directors in the United States. Machiavellianism was measured by responses to the Mach V scale (Christie & Geis, 1970).\r\n\r\nOne hundred library directors were drawn from each of four national sampling frames: Category I (doctoral) institutions and Category IIB (baccalaureate) institutions (according to Academe (March-April 1993)); law schools (according to The Official Guide to U.S. Law Schools, 1993-94); and medical schools (according to Medical School Admission Requirements, 1994-95). An overall usable response rate of 62% was achieved.\r\n\r\nFour hypotheses were evaluated. Hypothesis I predicted law school library directors would score higher on the Mach V scale than Category I institution library directors. No significant difference in Mach scores emerged between the two groups. Hypothesis II anticipated law school library directors would score higher on the Mach V scale than medical school library directors. No significant difference in Mach scores appeared between the two groups.\r\n\r\nHypothesis III expected law school library directors would score higher on the Mach V scale than Category IIB institution library directors. No significant difference in Mach scores arose between the two groups. Hypothesis IV speculated that Category I institution library directors would score higher on the Mach V scale than Category IIB institution library directors. No significant difference in Mach scores occurred between the two groups. Results indicated that the library directors sampled were fairly homogeneous in Machiavellian orientation.\r\n\r\nFour research questions examined Machiavellianism, library type and various demographic variables, such as age, gender, and education. All of the analyses yielded nonsignificant results with the exception of a significant main effect found for gender. In this research female library directors, across the four library types, consistently scored significantly higher in Machiavellianism than male library directors.','Occupational psychology','Higher education','Personality','1','9543340'),(784,'Gendered literacy through social media: A study of the KidLitosphere blogs','DT',2015,'Seitz, Emily M.','Ph.D.','Rutgers The State University of New Jersey - New Brunswick','','','','','','','','','','','','','United States','Rutgers The State University of New Jersey - New Brunswick','United States','interviews','','','http://login.ezproxy.library.ualberta.ca/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1748999797?accountid=14474','This dissertation observes and theorizes gendered literacy, a term that has so far been poorly defined.

These data, along with data collected from interviews, were qualitatively analyzed using the constant comparative method. Research questions included: (1) RQ1: What are the conceptions of gendered literacy among literacy educators (parents, public librarians, school librarians, and teachers); creators of texts for children (published authors, editors, and published illustrators); and, children/young adults, as represented in their blogging activities? (2) RQ2: How do the conceptions of gendered literacy identified through the blogging activities of literacy educators, creators of texts for children, and children/young adults compare to the theoretical conceptions identified in the literature review? (3) RQ3: What similarities and differences, if any, are represented in conceptions of gendered literacy among literacy educators; creators of texts for children; and, children/young adults, as represented in their blogging activities? (4) RQ4: What patterns, if any, of resistance to the dominant conceptions of gendered literacy may be found among the blog posts analyzed?\r\n\r\nProminent findings relate to educators’ perceptions of boys’ reading preferences and labeling of “boy” and “girl” books. Other findings relate to gendered literacy behaviors (other than reading preferences) and perceptions of these behaviors, including roughly equal numbers of examples describing boys’ love of reading and/or advanced reading level, as compared to those describing girls’. Implications for future practice include educators’ refraining from labeling of books according to boy/girl; encouraging positive perceptions of boys’ reading; motivating children to read in a resistant way – to read texts that would not be considered appropriate for their sex; encouraging producers of reading materials for youth to produce more gender-neutral materials; and, fostering children’s reading and literacy in ways that do not focus on gender.','Library science','Womens studies','Literacy','1','3734271'),(785,'A study of faculty teaching of information literacy in Alabama\'s public associate\'s colleges','DT',2010,'Everett, Julia Brookshire','Ed.D.','The University of Alabama','','','','','','','','','','','','','United States','The University of Alabama','United States','survey','','','http://login.ezproxy.library.ualberta.ca/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/851875922?accountid=14474','Technology has permeated almost every aspect of society. With this popularity of technology, information has become more accessible than ever. Because society has become inundated with information, it is more important than ever to prepare citizens to be educated consumers of information. Perhaps the community college, whose mission has always included lifelong learning, is the best type of institution to take on this mission.\r\n\r\nThis study used a survey to determine if full-time instructors who teach general education courses at public associate’s colleges in the state of Alabama were aware of national, as well as institutional, policies related to information literacy. In addition, this study examined the extent to which instructors at public associate’s colleges in Alabama were teaching information literacy skills to students in general education courses. This study also examined certain instructor-related factors such as age, years of teaching experience, educational background, and subject matter taught to see if those factors influenced whether instructors taught information literacy skills. In addition, this study explored the collaboration activities between instructors and librarians concerning information literacy instruction for students. Finally, this study sought to ascertain why instructors choosing not to teach information literacy skills did so.\r\n\r\nResults revealed that the majority of instructors were unaware of national policies concerning information literacy. In addition, almost half of the respondents were unaware if their institutions had policies concerning information literacy or not. This study also revealed that only two factors—degree earned and subject matter taught—played a significant role in whether instructors taught information literacy skills. As technology and information continue to play an even larger role in society, administrations at all levels—regional, state, and institutional—may want to consider formally incorporating information literacy into the curriculum.','Community college education','Library science','Higher Education Administration','1','3439809'),(786,'Libraries, families, and schools.

Primary data collection for this multiple-case study took place over eight months and involved semi-structured interviews and observations made by the researcher, as well as the review of library outreach documents. Interviews were transcribed, and along with observation data, coded to identify similarities and differences among librarians\' practices.\r\n\r\nThe study found that librarians were implementing the information obtained during the training session into their story-time and outreach practices, thereby incorporating current standards for kindergarten readiness. Furthermore, librarians reported that the training provided them with a deeper understanding of the importance of outreach to young children and families placed at-risk, and that they were engaged in a variety of outreach activities. Funding for additional library staff and professional development, as well as increased volunteer support would assist librarians in providing more frequent library-based activities, and more targeted outreach to support children\'s early literacy development.','Language arts','Preschool education','Literacy','1','3172648'),(787,'An analysis of the relationships between the perceived organizational climate and professional burnout in libraries and computing centers in West Virginia public higher education institutions','DT',2003,'Miller, Arnold R.','Ed.D.','Marshall University','','','','','','','','','','','','','United States','Marshall University','United States','questionnaire ','Correlation','ANOVA','http://login.ezproxy.library.ualberta.ca/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/305241437?accountid=14474','The purpose of this study was to determine the relationships between the perceived organizational climate and professional burnout in libraries and computing services units in West Virginia higher education. Research questions were defined to investigate the differences between libraries and computing services units in the perceived organizational climate, professional burnout, organizational climate vs. burnout, demographics vs. organizational climate, demographics vs. burnout, and the combined effects of demographics and organizational climate upon burnout. The Work Environment Scale (WES) Form R, third edition, the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) HSS, third edition, and a demographic questionnaire measured the organizational climate, burnout, and demographics. Standard research methods were used to collect, analyze, and report on the data. The research population was the 521 library and computing services staff and faculty employees of the West Virginia public higher education institutions. Correlation and ANOVA techniques were used. Findings included: (a) significant differences in gender distribution, percentage of supervisors, marital status, and faculty classification, but not in occurrence of direct client contact, age, education, or years in their profession or position, (b) significant divergences from the published norms for each measure of the WES or MBI toward a positive environment, except a significantly lower level of personal accomplishment compared to the postsecondary education norms, (c) significant differences in the organizational climate measures of Work Pressure, Clarity, and the Work Stressors Index, (d) no significant differences in burnout measures, (e) a significant relationship between positive environmental characteristics and lowered burnout indicators in both groups, (f) consistent relationships between demographics and organizational climate with other reported studies, (g) consistent relationships between demographics and burnout measures with other studies except no relationship with gender and a positive relationship between education and burnout, and (h) the Relationships dimension of the WES was the most important factor related to lower burnout measures for both units, however the WES Personal Growth dimension and general experience seemed to have a larger relationship with decreased burnout in computing services and the WES System Maintenance and Change dimension and being married have a larger relationship with decreased burnout in libraries.','Higher education','Social psychology','Occupational psychology','1','3114269'),(788,'Political influence on the Federal Communications Commission\'s rulemaking on universal service for schools and libraries','DT',1999,'Lewis, Patricia Figliola','Ph.D.','University of Florida','','','','','','','','','','','','','United States','University of Florida','United States','interview','','','http://login.ezproxy.library.ualberta.ca/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/304508857?accountid=14474','This dissertation examines the political influence within the telecommunications issue network during the schools and libraries portion of the Federal Communications Commission\'s (FCC\'s) universal service rulemaking. This rulemaking resulted in the “E-Rate Program” that provides schools and libraries with discounted Internet-related services. The overarching finding of this study is that current theory on the rulemaking process does not adequately explain this particular rulemaking. Further research is required to determine whether this study was out of the ordinary or not.\r\n\r\nThe primary theory used in this dissertation is issue network theory. This research supports the tenets of the theory (i.e., hollow cores, multiple niches, an importance placed on expertise, and sloppy boundaries), but found other theories, specifically symbolic politics and mobilization of bias, could be used to support it.\r\n\r\nThis study also examines whether the rulemaking adhered to theories of rulemaking developed by Cornelius Kerwin and Scott Furlong. Kerwin writes that the agency conducting the rulemaking (1) must provide information to, and collect information from the public; (2) must encourage wide participation from diverse voices; and (3) can be held accountable for their rules. This study conformed to the requirements laid out by Kerwin, but further analysis demonstrates that even though the FCC appeared to adhere to the requirements of Kerwin\'s theory, the FCC had in large part predetermined its general course of action prior to the beginning of the rulemaking.\r\n\r\nFurlong developed and tested the third theory used in this dissertation. Of the 7 criteria he believed affected groups, ability to influence rulemaking only forming coalitions and the level of access were significant in formal methods (e.g., rulemaking). The findings of this study generally support Furlong\'s findings.','Mass media','Political science','Public administration','1','9956607');
